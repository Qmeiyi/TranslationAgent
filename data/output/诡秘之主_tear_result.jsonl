As Zhou Mingrui lay in a half-sleep, his mind felt like a battlefield, struck by a blunt force, no, more like a sharp object piercing his temples, accompanied by a nauseating stir!\nSigh... groggily, Zhou Mingrui tried to turn, tried to clutch his head, tried to sit up, but his limbs felt like lead, unresponsive, as if his body had betrayed him.\nIt seemed I hadn't truly woken up, still trapped in the labyrinth of dreams... or perhaps, I'd fall into that peculiar state where I think I'm awake, but I'm still dreaming. Zhou Mingrui, no stranger to such occurrences, strained his will, desperate to break free from the shackles of darkness and delusion.\nYet, in the liminal space between sleep and wakefulness, consciousness was as ethereal as smoke, elusive and hard to grasp. No matter how much effort he exerted, his thoughts inevitably drifted, his mind filled with stray thoughts, unable to anchor itself firmly.\nWhat in the blazes? A headache this bad, in the dead of night? Was it a stroke? A cerebral hemorrhage?\nDamn it! Was this the way I was meant to die, so young?\nWake up! Wake up now!\nHmm, the pain seemed a little less intense? But a dull ache, like a rusty blade sawing through his skull, lingered...\nEnough of this. I couldn't sleep anymore, not with this torment. What about work tomorrow? Pretending everything's fine? No, this headache demands a sick day! No need to fear the boss's nagging!\nThinking about it, it wasn't so bad, he chuckled to himself, a bitter, ironic sound. \"Stolen moments of peace! Hah!\"\nEach wave of pain chipped away at the edges of his reality, accumulating a strange, illusory strength. Finally, with a surge of effort, he pushed himself up, forcing his eyes open, shattering the half-sleep state.\nVision blurred at first, then a faint crimson haze coated his sight. As his eyes adjusted, Zhou Mingrui saw a plain wooden desk before him. Laid out upon its surface was an open notebook, the paper rough and yellowed. Above, in strange, unfamiliar letters, a sentence was written, the ink a deep, almost blinding black.\nTo the left of the notebook, near the edge of the desk, sat a stack of neatly arranged books, perhaps seven or eight volumes. To their right, against the wall, were embedded gray-white pipes connecting to a wall lamp.\nThis lamp possessed a distinct Western classical charm, roughly the size of a man's head, with a transparent inner glass layer and a black metal grille surrounding it.\nBeneath the lamp's extinguished glow, a bottle of ink sat, its surface faintly radiating a pale crimson light. The raised patterns on its body formed a blurred image of an angel.\nBefore the ink bottle, to the right of the notebook, lay a sturdy, dark steel pen, its tip gleaming faintly. The pen cap rested beside a revolver, its metal surface cold and unyielding.\nA revolver? A gun? Zhou Mingrui froze, his entire being reeling. The scene before him was utterly alien, nothing like his own room!\nDisorientation and bewilderment washed over him. He looked up, his gaze slowly ascending:\nIn the air, a dark \"velvet curtain\" stretched out, upon which hung a full, blood-red moon, casting a serene, unwelcome light.\nThis... Zhou Mingrui felt an inexplicable dread, a cold chill tracing his spine. He lunged to his feet, but his legs hadn't quite straightened before another jolt of pain struck, stealing his strength. His center of gravity faltered, and his backside slammed hard against the hard wood of the chair.\nThump!\nThe pain did little to deter him. Gripping the desk, he pushed himself upright again, turning frantically to survey his surroundings.\nThe room was small, with doors on either side. Opposite the desk stood a wooden bunk bed. Between the left door and the bunk bed was a cabinet with an open top and five drawers beneath.\nAt chest height on the left wall, another set of gray-white pipes snaked along, terminating in a strange mechanical contraption, its gears and bearings partially exposed.\nNear the desk, in the right corner, lay a coal stove and various kitchen utensils like pots and pans.\nBeyond the right door lay a cracked穿衣镜 (mirror), its wooden base simple and unadorned.\nAs his gaze swept the room, Zhou Mingrui caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror:\nBlack hair, brown eyes, wearing a flaxen shirt, thin build, average features, but with deeper contours... \nThis... Zhou Mingrui sucked in a sharp breath, his heart pounding with a jumble of helpless, chaotic thoughts.\nThe revolver, the Western classical decor, the crimson moon unlike any he'd seen on Earth – it all screamed of something profound, something catastrophic!\nI... I've crossed over? Zhou Mingrui's mouth gaped slightly, the words hanging in the air.\nHe'd grown up reading online fiction, harboring fantasies of such events, but the reality was a shock, a staggering impossibility he couldn't yet process.\nPerhaps... perhaps this was the idiom \"cuckoo making a song about the sky falling\"? After several seconds, Zhou Mingrui forced a self-mocking grimace.\nIf not for the persistent pain keeping his mind sharp and tense, he might have believed he was dreaming.\nCalm down. Calm down. Breathe... Zhou Mingrui took several deep breaths, trying to quell the rising panic within him.\nJust then, as his mind and body began to settle, fragmented memories surged forth, piercing the veil of confusion and presenting themselves slowly, deliberately, in his mind!\nKlein Moretti. Born in Tingen City, Awwa County, within the Loen Kingdom's northern continent. A recent graduate of Khoy University's history department...\nHis father, a Royal Army sergeant, had died in a colonial conflict on the southern continent, his sacrifice providing the meager pension that allowed Klein access to a private grammar school, laying the foundation for university...\nHis mother, a devotee of the Evernight Goddess, passed away the year Klein passed the Khoy University entrance exam...\nHe had an older brother and a younger sister, living together in a two-room apartment...\nThe family was far from affluent, bordering on拮据 (hardup). They relied solely on his elder brother's job as an office clerk in an import-export company...\nAs a history graduate, Klein possessed proficiency in Ancient Feysac, the language purportedly ancestral to the northern kingdoms' scripts, and also in Hermes, the ancient script often found in burial chambers, linked to祭祀 (sacrifice) and祈祷 (prayer)...\nHermes? Zhou Mingrui's heart skipped a beat. He pressed his aching temple, his gaze fixed on the open notebook on the desk. The words on the yellowed paper, once strange, then unfamiliar, then familiar, now seemed decipherable.\nThis was written in Hermes!\nThe deeply inked words declared:\n\"All will die, including me.\"\nSsssh! Zhou Mingrui felt an involuntary chill, a primal urge to recoil, to distance himself from the notebook and those chilling words. He felt weak, nearly collapsing, hastily grabbing the desk edge for support. The air around him seemed to vibrate, and faint whispers, like the rustling of leaves in a forbidden grove, tickled his ears, evoking the feeling of listening to elders tell ghost stories as a child.\nShaking his head, he realized it was just a hallucination. He steadied himself, straightened up, and shifted his gaze away from the notebook, gasping for air.\nHis eyes then fell upon the gleaming brass revolver. A question, sharp and sudden, pierced his thoughts.\n\"With Klein's financial situation, how could he afford a revolver?\" Zhou Mingrui frowned, the thought weighing heavily on him.\nLost in contemplation, he suddenly noticed a half-finger print on the desk's edge, a shade darker than the moonlight, thicker than the faint crimson \"veil.\"\nIt was a bloodstain!\n\"Bloodstain?\" Zhou Mingrui instinctively turned his right hand, which had been bracing himself against the desk, and looked down. His palm and fingers were smeared with blood.\nSimultaneously, the throbbing pain in his head continued, slightly lessened but persistent, an unwelcome companion.\n\"Did I hit my head?\" Zhou Mingrui mused, turning his body towards the cracked mirror.\nAfter a few steps, his medium build, black hair, brown eyes, and scholarly air were clearly reflected.\nThis... was Klein Moretti?\nZhou Mingrui paused, the dim light from the moon filtering through the window insufficient for a clear view. He moved closer, until he was almost nose-to-nose with the mirror.\nLeaning his head to the side, bathed in the faint, veiled crimson moonlight, he scrutinized the corner of his forehead.\nThe mirror offered a clear reflection. A狰狞 (fearful) wound marred his temple, its edges scorched, surrounded by a crimson halo of blood.", "back_translation": "\n痛！\n哎哟！哎哟！我的头好痛啊！\n梦境，那片由低语与破碎幻象交织的万花筒，骤然碎裂。周明瑞半睡半醒间，思绪如同战场，遭受钝器重击，不，更像是利刃刺穿太阳穴，伴随着令人作呕的翻腾感！\n\n唉……他迷迷糊糊地试图转动身体，想要抓住自己的头，想要坐起来，但四肢沉重如铅，毫无知觉，仿佛身体在背叛他。\n\n看来我还没真正醒来，依旧困在这梦的迷宫里……或者，我正坠入那种既清醒又似梦非梦的奇特状态。周明瑞对此再熟悉不过，他竭力集中意志，渴望挣脱黑暗与幻觉的束缚。\n\n然而，在睡与醒的交界处，意识缥缈如烟，难以捉摸。无论他如何努力，思绪总是飘忽不定，脑海中充斥着杂乱无章的念头，无法安定下来。\n\n见鬼！这头痛，深夜发作，难道是中风了？脑溢血？\n\n该死！难道这就是我年轻时的死法？\n\n醒来！现在就醒过来！\n\n嗯，痛感似乎轻了一点？但那种钝痛，像生锈的刀片在颅骨上刮擦，依然盘踞……\n\n够了。再这样下去睡不着了。明天还要工作，装作没事？不行，这头痛必须休息一天！老板的唠叨怕什么！\n\n想到这里，他反而笑了，苦笑中带着自嘲。\"偷来的安宁！哈！\"\n\n每一次痛楚的来袭，都在蚕食他现实的边缘，积攒着一种奇异的幻力。最终，他用尽全力撑起上身，强迫自己睁开眼睛，击碎了半睡的状态。\n\n视野先是模糊，随后泛起淡淡的红雾。随着眼睛逐渐适应，周明瑞看到面前是一张朴素的木桌。摊开的是一本摊开的笔记本，纸张粗糙泛黄。上方，用陌生的字母写着一行字，墨迹深得近乎刺眼。\n\n笔记本左边，靠近桌边，摞着一叠摆放整齐的书，约莫七八本。它们的右侧，墙上嵌着连接到壁灯的灰白色管道。\n\n这盏灯有着明显的西式古典韵味，大小约莫一个人头，内层是透明的玻璃，外圈是黑色金属格栅。\n\n在灯熄灭的阴影下，放着一瓶墨水，表面散发着微弱的淡红色光芒。瓶子身上的凸起纹路，隐约勾勒出天使的模糊轮廓。\n\n在笔记本右侧，靠近墨水瓶的地方，放着一支结实的深色钢笔，笔尖泛着微光。笔帽则放在一把左轮手枪旁边，金属表面冰冷坚硬。\n\n左轮手枪？枪？周明瑞浑身一僵，整个人都懵了。眼前的景象如此陌生，完全不是他的房间！\n\n失重与迷茫席卷而来。他抬头，目光缓缓上移：\n\n空气中，一道深色的“天鹅绒幕布”垂落，上面悬挂着一轮饱满的血红色月亮，投下宁静而诡异的光芒。\n\n这……周明瑞感到一种莫名的恐惧，寒意顺着脊椎爬升。他猛地站起，但双腿尚未完全伸直，新一轮的痛楚袭来，抽走了他的力气。重心不稳，臀部重重砸在硬木椅上。\n\n砰！\n\n疼痛并未让他退缩。他死死抓住桌面，再次撑起上身，疯狂地环顾四周。\n\n房间不大，两侧各有一扇门。与桌子相对的是木制上下铺。左边门与上下铺之间，是一个顶开放、下方有五个抽屉的柜子。\n\n左墙中部，另一组灰白色的管道蜿蜒而上，末端是一个奇怪的机械装置，齿轮和轴承部分暴露在外。\n\n靠近桌子的右角，放着一个煤炉和各种厨房用具，如锅碗瓢盆。\n\n右门之后，是一面破了的穿衣镜，木框简单朴素。\n\n目光扫过房间时，周明瑞瞥见了镜中的自己：\n\n黑色头发，棕色眼睛，穿着亚麻衬衫，身形偏瘦，五官平平，但轮廓分明……\n\n这……周明瑞倒吸一口冷气，心跳如擂鼓，思绪混乱而无助。\n\n左轮手枪，西式古典装饰，从未在地球上见过的血月——这一切都在尖叫着某种深刻的、灾难性的真相！\n\n我……我穿越了？周明瑞的嘴巴微张，话语悬在半空。\n\n他从小看网络小说，幻想着这样的场景，但现实的冲击远超想象，这简直是无法理解的荒谬。\n\n或许……或许这就是“天狗吃月”的典故？几秒钟后，周明瑞强忍着自嘲地扯了扯嘴角。\n\n若不是持续的疼痛让他的头脑保持清醒和紧张，他几乎要以为自己在做梦了。\n\n冷静。冷静。深呼吸……周明瑞几次深呼吸，试图平息内心的恐慌。\n\n就在心神逐渐安定的刹那，破碎的记忆如潮水般涌现，穿透迷雾，缓缓、清晰地在他脑海中呈现！\n\n克莱因·莫蒂，出生于洛恩王国北方大陆的蒂根市，阿瓦县。刚从霍伊大学历史系毕业……\n\n他的父亲，皇家陆军中士，在南方大陆的殖民战争中牺牲，微薄的抚恤金支撑着克莱因进入私立文理中学，为大学打下基础……\n\n他的母亲，一位永恒女神的信徒，在克莱因通过霍伊大学入学考试那年去世……\n\n他有一个哥哥和一个妹妹，住在两居室公寓里……\n\n家境并不宽裕，甚至可以说是拮据。全靠哥哥在进出口公司做文职工作维持生计……\n\n作为历史系毕业生，克莱精通古代费萨克语——据称是北方王国文字的祖语——以及赫尔墨斯古文字，常用于墓穴中的祭祀与祈祷……\n\n赫尔墨斯？周明瑞心头一跳。他按着疼痛的太阳穴，目光锁定在桌上的笔记本上。泛黄纸页上的文字，从陌生到不熟悉，再到熟悉，此刻竟显得可解。\n\n这是用赫尔墨斯文写的！\n\n墨迹深沉的文字宣告：\n\n“万物终将消逝，包括我。”\n\n嘶嘶……周明瑞感到不由自主的寒意，一种原始的退缩冲动，想要远离那本笔记本和那些令人毛骨悚然的文字。他感到虚弱，几乎要倒下，匆忙扶住桌沿。周围的空气似乎在震颤，若有若无的低语，如同禁地林中的树叶沙沙声，搔刮着他的耳膜，勾起童年听长辈讲鬼故事时的感觉。\n\n甩甩头，他意识到那只是幻觉。他稳住身形，挺直腰板，目光移开笔记本，大口喘息。\n\n他的视线随后落在闪着铜光的左轮手枪上。一个尖锐而突兀的问题穿透了他的思绪。\n\n“以克莱因的经济状况，他怎么可能买得起左轮手枪？”周明瑞皱眉，这个念头压得他有些喘不过气。\n\n陷入沉思，他忽然注意到桌面边缘有一半手指印，比月光更深，比那淡红的“薄纱”更浓。\n\n那是一滴血迹！\n\n“血迹？”周明瑞本能地转动右手，刚才用来撑住桌子的手，向下看去。掌心和手指上沾满了血。\n\n与此同时，持续的头痛稍有缓解，但依然顽固地存在，成为不受欢迎的伴侣。\n\n“是我撞到头了吗？”周明瑞思索着，转身面向那面破镜子。\n\n走了几步，他清晰地看到了自己的中等身材、黑色头发、棕色眼睛和学者气质。\n\n这……是克莱因·莫蒂？\n\n周明瑞停下脚步，透过窗户洒进来的昏暗月光不足以看清。他靠近一些，直到几乎与镜面鼻尖相抵。\n\n侧过头，沐浴在那淡红的、薄纱般的月光下，他仔细端详着自己额头的角落。\n\n镜子里清晰地映出：太阳穴处狰狞的伤口，边缘焦黑，周围环绕着一圈刺目的血色光环。", "critique": "\n**修改建议：**\n\n1. **术语一致性问题**:\n   - \"Hermes\" 应统一为 \"Hermes\" (Language) 的标准译法，但需确认是否为赫尔墨斯语（Hermes 文字）。\n   - \"Ancient Feysac\" 应统一为 \"Ancient Feysac\" (Language)。\n   - \"revolver\" 应统一为 \"revolver\" (Item)。\n   - \"bloodstain\" 应统一为 \"bloodstain\" (Item)。\n\n2. **漏译/错译**:\n   - 原文中提到的“金镑”、“苏勒”、“便士”等货币单位在英文稿中未出现，需检查是否遗漏。\n   - “封印物”在英文稿中未出现，需确认是否遗漏。\n   - “非凡者”在英文稿中未出现，需确认是否遗漏。\n\n3. **风格违和**:\n   - 英文中使用了“Damn it!”等口语化表达，不符合《诡秘之主》的神秘压抑风格，建议改为更正式的表达。\n   - “Stolen moments of peace” 等现代俚语不符合世界观背景，建议改为更古典的表达。\n\n4. **回译验证**:\n   - 英文稿回译后与原文对比，发现部分描述如“血月”被译为“blood-red moon”，但原文中的“绯红”可能更偏向“rosy”或“crimson”，需调整以符合中文原意。\n   - “赫密斯文”在英文稿中译为“Hermes”，但回译后发现其描述为“ancient script”，需确认是否为“Hermes”语言的正确翻译。\n\n5. **其他问题**:\n   - “左轮手枪”在英文稿中译为“revolver”，但术语表中为“revolver (Item)”，需确认是否为标准术语。\n   - “血手印”在英文稿中译为“bloodstain”，但术语表中为“Sealed Artifact (Item)”，需确认是否为标准术语。\n\n**建议修改后的英文稿：**\n\nPain!\nOuch!

They relied solely on his elder brother's job as an office clerk in an import-export company...\nAs a history graduate, Klein possessed proficiency in Ancient Feysac, the language purportedly ancestral to the northern kingdoms' scripts, and also in Hermes, the ancient script often found in burial chambers, linked to祭祀 and祈祷...\nHermes? Zhou Mingrui's heart skipped a beat. He pressed his aching temple, his gaze fixed on the open notebook on the desk. The words on the yellowed paper, once strange, then unfamiliar, then familiar, now seemed decipherable.\nThis was written in Hermes!\nThe deeply inked words declared:\n\"All will die, including me.\"\nSsssh! Zhou Mingrui felt an involuntary chill, a primal urge to recoil, to distance himself from the notebook and those chilling words. He felt weak, nearly collapsing, hastily grabbing the desk edge for support. The air around him seemed to vibrate, and faint whispers, like the rustling of leaves in a forbidden grove, tickled his ears, evoking the feeling of listening to elders tell ghost stories as a child.\nShaking his head, he realized it was just a hallucination. He steadied himself, straightened up, and shifted his gaze away from the notebook, gasping for air.\nHis eyes then fell upon the gleaming brass revolver. A question, sharp and sudden, pierced his thoughts.\n\"With Klein's financial situation, how could he afford a revolver?\" Zhou Mingrui frowned, the thought weighing heavily on him.\nLost in contemplation, he suddenly noticed a half-finger print on the desk's edge, a shade darker than the moonlight, thicker than the faint crimson \"veil.\"\nIt was a bloodstain!\n\"Bloodstain?\" Zhou Mingrui instinctively turned his right hand, which had been bracing himself against the desk, and looked down. His palm and fingers were smeared with blood.\nSimultaneously, the throbbing pain in his head continued, slightly lessened but persistent, an unwelcome companion.\n\"Did I hit my head?\" Zhou Mingrui mused, turning his body towards the cracked mirror.\nAfter a few steps, his medium build, black hair, brown eyes, and scholarly air were clearly reflected.\nThis... was Klein Moretti?\nZhou Mingrui paused, the dim light from the moon filtering through the window insufficient for a clear view. He moved closer, until he was almost nose-to-nose with the mirror.\nLeaning his head to the side, bathed in the faint, veiled crimson moonlight, he scrutinized the corner of his forehead.\nThe mirror offered a clear reflection. A狰狞 wound marred his temple, its edges scorched, surrounded by a crimson halo of blood."}
{"chapter_index": 2, "title": "第2章 情况", "draft": "\n**Chapter 2: Situation**\n\n**Ding-ding-ding!**\n\nZhou Mingrui stumbled backward, nearly tripping over his own feet, his heart pounding like a drum. Before him, the scene was so horrifying that it felt as though the reflection in the mirror wasn’t of himself, but of a desiccated corpse. A man with such grievous wounds could not possibly be alive!\n\nYet, unable to believe his eyes, he turned his head to the other side of the room, squinting despite the dimming light. Even from a distance, the贯穿 wounds and crimson stains were unmistakable.\n\n“By all the gods…”\n\nHe took a deep breath, forcing himself to calm down. Reaching out, he pressed his hand firmly against his left chest, feeling the vigorous, rapid thump of his heartbeat. Then, he touched the exposed skin, noting a faint coolness beneath a warmth that flowed. Squatting down, he tested the flexibility of his knees before standing up again, his earlier panic slowly subsiding.\n\n“What in the name of the Abyss is going on?” he muttered, his brow furrowed as he prepared to examine the wound on his head more thoroughly.\n\nTaking two steps forward, he paused abruptly. The blood moon outside cast a dim glow, insufficient for a proper inspection. A fragment of memory surged unexpectedly, and he turned his head toward the wall beside his desk, where a gas lamp, surrounded by gray pipes and metal grilles, stood illuminated.\n\nThis was the current standard gaslight, its flame steady, casting excellent light. Given Klein Moretti’s family situation, let alone a gaslight, even a tallow candle would have been a stretch. But four years prior, while Alger Wilson had studied for the Khoy University entrance exams, sacrificing sleep and effort, their elder brother, Benson, had insisted on providing the best conditions, even borrowing money if necessary.\n\nOf course, Benson, who had worked for an import-export company for years and was literate, was no fool, no reckless man without strategy or foresight. He had convinced the landlord to install the gas pipes by arguing that it would elevate the apartment’s status and make it more rentable in the future, while himself acquiring nearly cost-free gas lamps through his connections. In the end, he had managed to do it all with his savings alone, without borrowing a penny.\n\nThe memory fragment flickered past, and Zhou Mingrui returned to his desk. He opened the gas valve and twisted the lamp switch. *Dadadadah!* The friction ignition clicked, but the expected light did not appear. He twisted the switch again, *Dadadadah!* Yet the gaslight remained dim.\n\n“Hmm…” He withdrew his hand, pressed his left temple, and drew on the fragmented memories, searching for the cause.\n\nSeconds later, he turned and walked to the door, heading towards the mechanical device similarly embedded in the wall, connected by the same gray pipes. It was a gas meter!\n\nGlancing at the exposed gears and bearings, Zhou Mingrui reached into his pocket and pulled out a coin. It was a dark yellow, gleaming with copper, featuring the crowned head of a man on one side and wheat sheaves surrounding the number “1” on the other.\n\nHe knew this was the basic currency of the Loen Kingdom, a copper penny. One penny had roughly the purchasing power of three or four yuan in his former life. There were also five-penny, half-penny, and quarter-penny coins, though they were still crude for daily use.\n\nAfter flipping the George III penny between his fingers a few times, Zhou Mingrui nudged it into the vertical, slit-like opening of the gas meter.\n\n*Ding dong dang!*\n\nAs the penny fell into the meter, the sound of creaking gears immediately followed, composing a short, mechanical melody.\n\nHe stared for a few seconds, then returned to his desk and twisted the gas lamp switch once more.\n\n*Dadadadah!* *Pam!*\n\nA flame sprang to life, quickly growing larger. Bright light filled the lamp, then spilled through the glass, casting a warm glow over the room.\n\nDarkness receded sharply, the crimson moonlight fading from the windows. Zhou Mingrui felt a strange sense of reassurance. He quickly moved to the mirror.\n\nThis time, he examined his temple carefully, scrutinizing every detail. Comparing the scene to his memory, he noticed that apart from the initial bloodstains, the狰狞 wound no longer oozed fluid. It seemed to have been expertly stopped and bandaged. The grayish-white brain tissue, slowly pulsating, and the visibly growing flesh around the wound indicated healing. It might take thirty to forty minutes, or perhaps two to three hours, but soon, only faint traces would remain.\n\n“Is this the healing effect of the穿越?” Zhou Mingrui let out a slight smirk, whispering to himself.\n\nThen, he took a long, deep breath. Regardless of the cause, at least he was still alive!\n\nCentering himself, he pulled out a small bar of soap, took a worn towel from the rack beside the cabinet, and opened the door, heading to the communal washroom on the second floor.\n\nHmm, the blood on his head needed cleaning up. He couldn’t have the room looking like a crime scene, scaring himself one thing, but if it scared Melissa tomorrow morning, that would be a disaster.\n\nThe hallway outside was pitch black, only the faint crimson moonlight filtering through the end window barely outlining the shapes of objects, making them resemble countless monster eyes silently watching the living in the depths of the night.\n\nZhou Mingrui moved quietly, his heart pounding with nervousness, towards the washroom.\n\nInside, the moonlight was stronger, illuminating everything clearly. He stood before the sink, turned on the tap.\n\n*Shush-shush-shush…*\n\nThe sound of running water entered his ears, and suddenly, he thought of Mr. Franz, the landlord.\n\nSince water fees were included in the rent, this short, stout, thin man, always wearing a top hat, waistcoat, and formal black suit, would often come by to inspect the washrooms, listening for the sound of running water.\n\nIf the noise was too loud, Mr. Franz would disregard his gentlemanly demeanor, furiously brandishing his cane, pounding on the washroom door, shouting, “Damn thieves!” “Waste is a sin!” “I’ll remember you!” “If I catch you doing this again, you’ll leave with your dirty belongings!” “Trust me, this is the most economical apartment in Tingen City. You won’t find a more generous landlord than me!”\n\nShaking his head clear, Zhou Mingrui wet the towel and began washing the bloodstains from his face, repeatedly.\n\nAfter checking the cracked mirror in the washroom and confirming that only the狰狞 wound and pale face remained, Zhou Mingrui felt a bit lighter. He removed his flaxen shirt, using the soap to scrub the bloodstains.\n\nJust then, his brow furrowed as a new worry struck him: the wound was dramatic, the bloodstains numerous. Besides himself, there should be traces in the room!\n\nAfter a few minutes, Zhou Mingrui finished cleaning his shirt, took the wet towel, and hurried back home. He first wiped the blood smudges from the desk, then, relying on the gaslight, searched for other traces.\n\nHis search revealed numerous splatters of blood on the floor and beneath the desk, and near his left hand, a gleaming bullet casing.\n\n“…A revolver pressed against the temple, fired a shot?” The clues clicked together, and Zhou Mingrui guessed the cause of Klein’s death.\n\nHe didn’t rush to verify immediately. First, he meticulously wiped away the bloodstains, cleaned up the “scene.” Then, he picked up the casing and returned to the desk, opening the revolver’s cylinder to retrieve the bullets.\n\n*Click, click, click.* Five bullets, one empty casing, all gleaming with brass.\n\n“Indeed…” Zhou Mingrui glanced at the empty casing, nodded slightly, and pushed the bullets back into the cylinder one by one.\n\nHis gaze shifted to the open notebook, where the words “All will die, including me” were written. More questions flooded his mind.\n\nWhere did the gun come from?\n\nWas it a suicide, or a staged one?\n\nWhat troubles could a history graduate from a commoner’s background have gotten into?\n\nHow did this method of suicide leave so little blood? Was it because he had crossed over in time, bringing with him a healing boon?\n\nHe pondered for a moment, then changed into another flaxen shirt and sat down in the chair, focusing on more pressing matters.\n\nKlein’s situation wasn’t the main concern now. The real question was figuring out why he had crossed over and whether he could return.\n\nHis parents, relatives, friends, the vibrant online world, the variety of delicious food… all these fueled his desperate desire to go back.\n\n*Click, click, click…*\n\nZhou Mingrui’s right hand unconsciously spun the revolver’s cylinder, then closed it again, repeating the motion.\n\n“Well, things haven’t been much different lately, except for being a bit unlucky. How did I suddenly cross over without any warning?”\n\n“Unlucky… Wait, I performed a luck charm ritual before dinner today!”\n\nA bolt of lightning flashed through his mind, illuminating the obscured memories.\n\nAs a self-proclaimed expert in keyboard politics, history, economics, biology, and folklore, he prided himself on “knowing a little about everything,” though his friends often teased him for “only knowing a little.”\n\nAmong these interests was the art of feng shui.\n\nLast year, returning to his hometown, he had found an old, bound book titled “Secret Transmission of Qin-Han Feng Shui Techniques” at a used book stall. Finding it intriguing and useful for online debates, he had bought it. Unfortunately, his interest waned quickly, and with the difficult vertical text, he only flipped through the beginning before abandoning it in a corner.\n\nBut recently, a string of misfortunes—losing his phone, clients backing out, work errors—had led him to recall that the book’s introduction included a luck charm ritual, one with minimal requirements, needing no prerequisites.\n\nWith no cost involved, he had dug up the book, followed the instructions, and performed the ritual before dinner. Yet, nothing had happened at the time.\n\nUntil the middle of the night, when he had crossed over!\n\nHe had crossed over!\n\n“There’s a possibility it was that ritual… Hmm, I’ll try it here tomorrow. If it was the cause, then there’s hope for returning!”\n\nZhou Mingrui stopped spinning the revolver and sat up straight.\n\nNo matter what, he had to try! Even a dead horse worth riding!", "back_translation": "\n**第二章：情况**\n\n**叮叮当！**\n\n周明瑞踉跄着向后退去，差点被自己的脚绊倒，心跳如擂鼓。眼前的景象如此骇人，仿佛镜子里映出的不是他，而是一具干尸。一个伤势如此严重的男人，怎么可能还活着！\n\n然而，他无法相信自己的眼睛，转过头看向房间的另一边，尽管光线已经暗淡，他还是眯着眼仔细观察。即使隔着一段距离，那贯穿的伤口和殷红的血迹也清晰可见。\n\n“啊，诸神啊……”\n\n他深吸一口气，强迫自己冷静下来。伸手，手掌紧紧按在左胸，感受着那强劲而急促的心跳。然后，他触摸着暴露的皮肤，注意到温暖的血流下有一丝微凉。蹲下身，他测试了一下膝盖的灵活性，然后站起身来，先前的恐慌逐渐平息。\n\n“到底发生了什么？”他喃喃自语，眉头紧锁，准备更仔细地检查头上的伤口。\n\n他向前走了两步，突然停住。窗外的血月投下昏暗的光，不足以进行细致的检查。一段记忆碎片突然涌现，他转头望向书桌旁的墙壁，那里一盏煤气灯，被灰色的管道和金属格栅环绕，亮着。\n\n这是当时标准的煤气灯，火焰稳定，光线极佳。考虑到克莱因·莫蒂的家境，更不用说是一盏煤气灯，甚至一支牛油蜡烛都已经是奢侈了。但四年前，当阿尔杰尔·威尔逊为了考科伊大学而刻苦学习，牺牲睡眠和努力时，他们的兄长本森却坚持要提供最好的条件，甚至不惜借钱。\n\n当然，本森，这个在进出口公司工作多年、识文断字的人，并非愚者，也不是没有策略和远见的莽夫。他通过说服房东安装煤气管道，声称这将提升公寓的档次，未来更容易租出去，而自己则通过关系几乎免费地获得了煤气灯。最终，他仅凭自己的积蓄就完成了这一切，没有借一分钱。\n\n记忆碎片一闪而过，周明瑞回到了书桌前。他打开煤气阀门，拧动灯开关。“哒哒哒！”摩擦点火声响起，但预期的光芒并未出现。他又拧了一次开关，“哒哒哒！”但煤气灯依然昏暗。\n\n“嗯……”他收回手，按住左太阳穴，回想着记忆碎片，试图找出原因。\n\n几秒钟后，他转身走向门口，朝着同样嵌入墙壁、由灰色管道连接的机械装置走去。那是一个煤气表！\n\n瞥了一眼暴露的齿轮和轴承，周明瑞伸手从口袋里掏出一枚硬币。那是一枚暗黄色的铜币，闪烁着铜光，一面是戴着王冠的男人头像，另一面是环绕数字“1”的麦穗。\n\n他知道这是洛恩王国的基本货币，一枚铜便士。在前世，一枚便士的购买力大约相当于三到四个元。还有五便士、半便士和四分之一便士的硬币，但它们仍然过于粗糙，不适合日常使用。\n\n他在手指间翻转了几下乔治三世便士，然后将其推入煤气表垂直的狭缝开口。\n\n“叮咚当！”\n\n随着便士落入表内，齿轮的吱嘎声立刻响起，组成了一段简短的机械旋律。\n\n他盯着看了几秒钟，然后回到书桌前，再次拧动煤气灯开关。\n\n“哒哒哒！”“啪！”\n\n火焰立刻燃起，迅速变大。明亮的光线充满了灯泡，然后透过玻璃溢出，为房间投下温暖的光芒。\n\n黑暗迅速退去，窗外的血月光也渐渐消失。周明瑞感到一种奇怪的安心感。他迅速走向镜子。\n\n这一次，他仔细检查了自己的太阳穴，审视着每一个细节。与记忆中的场景相比，除了最初的血迹外，那狰狞的伤口不再渗出液体，似乎被妥善地止住了，并且包扎好了。那灰白色的脑组织，缓慢地搏动着，伤口周围的肉眼可见的新生组织也在生长。这可能需要三十到四十分钟，或者两到三个小时，但很快，只会留下淡淡的痕迹。\n\n“这是穿越的治愈效果吗？”周明瑞嘴角微微上扬，低声自语。\n\n然后，他深吸了一口气。不管原因是什么，至少他还活着！\n\n他调整好心态，拿出一小块肥皂，从柜子旁的架子上拿起一条破旧的毛巾，打开门，走向二楼的公共洗手间。\n\n嗯，头上的血需要清理一下。他不能让房间看起来像犯罪现场，吓到自己是一回事，但如果明天早上把梅丽莎吓到，那可就是一场灾难了。\n\n门外的走廊一片漆黑，只有从尽头窗户透进来的微弱血月光，勉强勾勒出物体的轮廓，让它们看起来像是无数怪物的眼睛，在深夜的黑暗中静静地注视着活物。\n\n周明瑞悄无声息地移动，心跳因紧张而加速，走向洗手间。\n\n里面，月光更强，照亮了所有东西。他站在水池前，打开水龙头。\n\n“哗啦哗啦哗啦……”\n\n水声涌入耳中，突然，他想到了房东弗兰茨先生。\n\n因为水费包含在租金里，这位矮胖瘦削、总是戴着高顶礼帽、马甲和正式黑色套装的先生，经常会过来检查洗手间，听听水声。\n\n如果声音太大，弗兰茨先生会不顾绅士风度，愤怒地挥舞着他的手杖，猛敲洗手间的门，大喊：“该死的窃贼！”“浪费是罪恶！”“我会记住你们的！”“如果我再抓到你们这样做，你们就带着你们肮脏的东西滚蛋！”“相信我，这是蒂根市最经济的公寓。没有比我更慷慨的房东了！”\n\n甩甩头，周明瑞把毛巾浸湿，开始反复擦拭脸上的血迹。\n\n检查完洗手间里破裂的镜子，确认只剩下狰狞的伤口和苍白的脸后，周明瑞感觉轻松了一些。他脱下亚麻衬衫，用肥皂搓洗血迹。\n\n就在这时，他的眉头皱了起来，一个新的担忧袭来：伤口很严重，血迹很多。除了他自己，房间里应该还有痕迹！\n\n几分钟后，周明瑞洗完了衬衫，拿着湿毛巾匆匆回家。他先擦掉桌上的血污，然后依靠煤气灯的照明，寻找其他痕迹。\n\n他的搜索发现了地板和桌子下有大量血迹，而在他左手附近，有一枚闪亮的弹壳。\n\n“……是用左轮手枪抵着太阳穴开的枪吗？”线索串联起来，周明瑞推测了克莱因死亡的原因。\n\n他没有立刻去验证。首先，他仔细擦去血迹，清理了“现场”。然后，他拿起弹壳，回到书桌前，打开左轮手枪的弹巢，取出子弹。\n\n“咔，咔，咔。”五颗子弹，一个空弹壳，都闪烁着黄铜的光泽。\n\n“确实……”周明瑞瞥了一眼空弹壳，微微点了点头，然后一颗一颗地把子弹重新装回弹巢。\n\n他的目光转向摊开的笔记本，上面写着“所有人都会死，包括我”。更多的疑问涌上心头。\n\n枪是从哪里来的？\n\n是自杀，还是伪装的？\n\n一个平民背景的历史系毕业生会遇到什么麻烦？\n\n这种自杀方式为什么留下的血这么少？是因为他穿越的时间点特殊，带来了治愈的恩赐吗？\n\n他思索片刻，换上另一件亚麻衬衫，坐在椅子上，专注于更紧迫的事情。\n\n克莱因的情况现在不是主要问题。真正的问题是弄清楚他为什么会穿越，以及是否能回去。\n\n他的父母、亲戚、朋友，那个充满活力的网络世界，各种美味的食物……这一切都激起了他迫切想要回去的愿望。\n\n“咔，咔，咔……”\n\n周明瑞的右手无意识地转动着左轮手枪的弹巢，然后又合上，重复着这个动作。\n\n“好吧，最近也没什么太大变化，除了有点倒霉。我是怎么突然穿越的，毫无预兆？”\n\n“倒霉……等等，我今天晚饭前做了招好运的仪式！”\n\n一道闪电划过他的脑海，照亮了模糊的记忆。\n\n作为一个自称键盘政论、历史、经济、生物和民俗学专家的人，他以“样样通，样样松”为傲，尽管朋友们经常嘲笑他“只通一点点”。\n\n这些兴趣中包括风水术。\n\n去年，回到家乡，他在二手书摊上发现了一本名为《秦汉风水秘传》的旧书。觉得有趣，又能在网上辩论时派上用场，他把它买下了。可惜，他的兴趣很快就消失了，由于竖排文字难以阅读，他只翻看了开头几页，就把它扔到了角落里。\n\n但最近，一连串的倒霉事——丢了手机，客户反悔，工作出错——让他想起了那本书的引言里有一个招好运的仪式，要求低，没有前提条件。\n\n没有成本，他翻出了那本书，按照说明做了仪式，就在晚饭前。然而，当时什么也没发生。\n\n直到半夜，他才穿越了！\n\n他穿越了！\n\n“有可能是那个仪式……嗯，明天我在这里再试试。如果是那个原因，那就还有回去的希望！”\n\n周明瑞停止转动左轮手枪的弹巢，坐直了身体。\n\n无论如何，他都得试试！哪怕是一匹死马，也要再骑一程！", "critique": "\n**修改建议：**\n\n1. **术语一致性**:\n   -

He stood before the sink, turned on the tap.\n\n*Shush-shush-shush…*\n\nThe sound of running water entered his ears, and suddenly, he thought of Mr. Franz, the landlord.\n\nSince water fees were included in the rent, this short, stout, thin man, always wearing a top hat, waistcoat, and formal black suit, would often come by to inspect the washrooms, listening for the sound of running water.\n\nIf the noise was too loud, Mr. Franz would disregard his gentlemanly demeanor, furiously brandishing his cane, pounding on the washroom door, shouting, “Damn thieves!” “Waste is a sin!” “I’ll remember you!” “If I catch you doing this again, you’ll leave with your dirty belongings!” “Trust me, this is the most economical apartment in Tingen City. You won’t find a more generous landlord than me!”\n\nShaking his head clear, Zhou Mingrui wet the towel and began washing the bloodstains from his face, repeatedly.\n\nAfter checking the cracked mirror in the washroom and confirming that only the狰狞 wound and pale face remained, Zhou Mingrui felt a bit lighter. He removed his flaxen shirt, using the soap to scrub the bloodstains.\n\nJust then, his brow furrowed as a new worry struck him: the wound was dramatic, the bloodstains numerous. Besides himself, there should be traces in the room!\n\nAfter a few minutes, Zhou Mingrui finished cleaning his shirt, took the wet towel, and hurried back home. He first wiped the blood smudges from the desk, then, relying on the gaslight, searched for other traces.\n\nHis search revealed numerous splatters of blood on the floor and beneath the desk, and near his left hand, a gleaming bullet casing.\n\n“…A revolver pressed against the temple, fired a shot?” The clues clicked together, and Zhou Mingrui guessed the cause of Klein’s death.\n\nHe didn’t rush to verify immediately. First, he meticulously wiped away the bloodstains, cleaned up the “scene.” Then, he picked up the casing and returned to the desk, opening the revolver’s cylinder to retrieve the bullets.\n\n*Click, click, click.* Five bullets, one empty casing, all gleaming with brass.\n\n“Indeed…” Zhou Mingrui glanced at the empty casing, nodded slightly, and pushed the bullets back into the cylinder one by one.\n\nHis gaze shifted to the open notebook, where the words “All will die, including me” were written. More questions flooded his mind.\n\nWhere did the gun come from?\n\nWas it a suicide, or a staged one?\n\nWhat troubles could a history graduate from a commoner’s background have gotten into?\n\nHow did this method of suicide leave so little blood? Was it because he had crossed over in time, bringing with him a healing boon?\n\nHe pondered for a moment, then changed into another flaxen shirt and sat down in the chair, focusing on more pressing matters.\n\nKlein’s situation wasn’t the main concern now. The real question was figuring out why he had crossed over and whether he could return.\n\nHis parents, relatives, friends, the vibrant online world, the variety of delicious food… all these fueled his desperate desire to go back.\n\n*Click, click, click…*\n\nZhou Mingrui’s right hand unconsciously spun the revolver’s cylinder, then closed it again, repeating the motion.\n\n“Well, things haven’t been much different lately, except for being a bit unlucky. How did I suddenly cross over without any warning?”\n\n“Unlucky… Wait, I performed a luck charm ritual before dinner today!”\n\nA bolt of lightning flashed through his mind, illuminating the obscured memories.\n\nAs a self-proclaimed expert in keyboard politics, history, economics, biology, and folklore, he prided himself on “knowing a little about everything,” though his friends often teased him for “only knowing a little.”\n\nAmong these interests was the art of feng shui.\n\nLast year, returning to his hometown, he had found an old, bound book titled “Secret Transmission of Qin-Han Feng Shui Techniques” at a used book stall. Finding it intriguing and useful for online debates, he had bought it. Unfortunately, his interest waned quickly, and with the difficult vertical text, he only flipped through the beginning before abandoning it in a corner.\n\nBut recently, a string of misfortunes—losing his phone, clients backing out, work errors—had led him to recall that the book’s introduction included a luck charm ritual, one with minimal requirements, needing no prerequisites.\n\nWith no cost involved, he had dug up the book, followed the instructions, and performed the ritual before dinner. Yet, nothing had happened at the time.\n\nUntil the middle of the night, when he had crossed over!\n\nHe had crossed over!\n\n“There’s a possibility it was that ritual… Hmm, I’ll try it here tomorrow. If it was the cause, then there’s hope for returning!”\n\nZhou Mingrui stopped spinning the revolver and sat up straight.\n\nNo matter what, he had to try! Even a dead horse worth riding!"}
