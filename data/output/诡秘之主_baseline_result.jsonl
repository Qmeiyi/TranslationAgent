{"chapter_index": 1, "title": "第1章 绯红", "baseline_translation": "\nPain!\nSuch pain!\nMy head hurts so much!\nThe bizarre and murmuring dreams shattered in an instant, and as Zhou Mingrui lay in a deep sleep, he felt an intense throbbing pain in his head, as if struck by a club, no, more like a sharp object piercing his temples and stirring within!\n\nHiss... groggily, Zhou Mingrui tried to turn over, to cover his head, to sit up, but he couldn’t move a muscle, as if his body had lost control.\n\nIt seems I haven’t truly woken up yet, still in a dream... I might even experience that feeling of thinking I’m awake but am still asleep... Zhou Mingrui, who wasn’t unfamiliar with such scenarios, strained his will, desperately trying to break free from the darkness and the illusions.\n\nBut in the half-sleep state, his will felt as elusive as smoke, hard to grasp or contain. No matter how hard he tried, his thoughts kept drifting, random thoughts surfacing.\n\nWhat on earth could cause such a sudden, severe headache in the dead of night?\n\nCould it be a hemorrhage or something like that?\n\nDamn it, am I about to die young?\n\nWake up! Wake up!\n\nHmm, it seems less painful than before? But there’s still this dull ache, like a dull knife slowly carving into my brain...\n\nI can’t fall back asleep now; how will I get to work tomorrow?\n\nThinking about work? With a real headache, of course, I should take a sick day! No need to worry about my boss nagging me!\n\nThinking like this, it actually doesn’t sound so bad, hehe, stealing a half-day of freedom!\n\nRound after round of sharp pain allowed Zhou Mingrui to gradually accumulate a faint, illusory strength. Finally, he pushed himself up with a surge of effort, opening his eyes wide and completely shaking off the half-conscious state.\n\nHis vision was blurry at first, then it clouded with a faint crimson hue. As his gaze cleared, he saw a rustic wooden desk before him, with an open notebook lying in the center. The paper was rough and yellowed, and a strange line of text was written at the top in dark, dripping ink that stood out vividly.\n\nTo the left of the notebook, near the edge of the desk, sat a stack of neatly arranged books, probably seven or eight of them. To their right, on the wall, were gray-white pipes connected to a wall lamp. This lamp had a distinctly Western classical style, about half the size of a human head. The inner layer was transparent glass, and the outer layer was framed by black metal grilles.\n\nBeneath the lamp, a black inkwell was surrounded by a faint reddish glow, its surface etched with blurry angelic patterns.\n\nBefore the notebook, on the right side, rested a dark steel pen with a rounded belly, its tip shimmering with a faint light. The pen cap lay beside a yellow-brass revolver.\n\nA revolver? Zhou Mingrui froze, his entire body stunned. The scene before him was utterly unfamiliar, nothing like his own room!\n\nOverwhelmed and bewildered, he noticed that the desk, the notebook, the inkwell, and even the revolver were all veiled in a layer of crimson \"gauze\"—the light filtering in from outside.\n\nWithout thinking, he raised his head and slowly shifted his gaze upward:\n\nIn the air, a dark \"velvet curtain\" hung, upon which a blood-red full moon hung high, casting a serene light.\n\nThis... Zhou Mingrui was overcome by a strange fear. He abruptly stood up, but his legs hadn’t fully straightened when another sharp pain struck, stealing his strength and causing him to lose balance. His backside slammed hard against the hard wood of the chair.\n\n*Crack!*\n\nThe pain didn’t deter him; he placed his hands on the desk and stood up again, turning his body frantically to survey his surroundings.\n\nThis was a small room with two brown doors on either side. Opposite the wall was a wooden bunk bed. Between the left door and the bunk bed stood a cabinet with an upper section that opened and five drawers below. At eye level on the cabinet, gray-white pipes were embedded in the wall, connecting to a strange mechanical device with some exposed gears and bearings.\n\nNear the right wall, by the desk, was a pile of coal-burning stoves and kitchen utensils like pots and pans. Beyond the right door was a cracked穿衣镜 with a simple wooden base.\n\nAs he scanned the room, Zhou Mingrui caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror: black hair, brown eyes, wearing a flaxen shirt, thin build, average features with deep contours...\n\nThis... Zhou Mingrui gasped, his heart filled with a sense of helplessness and confusion.\n\nThe revolver, the Western classical decor, and that crimson moon unlike Earth’s—all pointed to something!\n\nDid I... did I travel? Zhou Mingrui’s mouth slowly opened.\n\nHe’d grown up reading online novels and often fantasized about such things, but when it actually happened, he found it hard to accept.\n\nThis must be the saying, \"Ye Gong’s love of dragons,\" Zhou Mingrui sarcastically remarked to himself after a minute or so.\n\nIf not for the persistent pain keeping his mind sharp, he might have believed he was still dreaming.\n\nCalm down, calm down, calm down... Taking several deep breaths, Zhou Mingrui tried to steady himself.\n\nJust then, as his mind and body harmonized, fragments of memory abruptly surfaced and slowly unfolded in his mind!\n\nCai Lian. Mo Lei Ti, from the northern continent’s Luon Kingdom, Aihua County, Tinggu City. A recent graduate from the History Department of Huoyi University...\n\nHis father was a Royal Army Sergeant, who sacrificed himself in a colonial conflict on the southern continent. The compensation money allowed Cai Lian to attend a private grammar school, laying the foundation for his university education...\n\nHis mother, a devotee of the Night Goddess, passed away the year he passed the Huoyi University entrance exam...\n\nHe had an older brother and a younger sister, living together in a two-bedroom apartment...\n\nThe family wasn’t wealthy, perhaps even struggling. They relied on his older brother, who worked as an office clerk at an import-export company...\n\nAs a history graduate, Cai Lian had mastered the ancient Fasack language, said to be the source of all northern continent scripts, as well as the Hermes Text—often found in ancient tombs, related to祭祀 and祈祷...\n\nHermes Text? Zhou Mingrui’s heart skipped a beat. He pressed his aching temples and looked at the open notebook on the desk. The strange text on the yellowed paper began to shift from strange to familiar, from unfamiliar to recognizable.\n\nThis was written in the Hermes Text!\n\nThe deeply inked words read:\n\n\"All will die, including me.\"\n\nHiss! Zhou Mingrui was unnerved, instinctively leaning back, trying to distance himself from the notebook and those words.\n\nHe felt weak, nearly falling, so he grabbed the desk edge, his body trembling. The air around him seemed agitated, and faint whispers echoed in his ears, like listening to scary stories as a child.\n\nShaking his head, he realized it was just a hallucination. He steadied himself and looked away from the notebook, taking deep breaths.\n\nHis gaze then fell on the revolver gleaming with brass. A question suddenly popped into his mind.\n\n\"With Cai Lian’s financial situation, how could he afford a gun?\"\n\nZhou Mingrui frowned.\n\nAs he pondered, he noticed a half-finger print of red on the edge of the desk, darker than the moonlight, thicker than the \"gauze.\"\n\nIt was a bloodstain!\n\n\"Bloodstain?\" Zhou Mingrui instinctively turned his right hand, which had been holding the desk edge, and looked down. His palm and fingers were covered in blood.\n\nAt the same time, the throbbing pain in his head continued, slightly less intense but persistent.\n\n\"Did I hit my head?\" Zhou Mingrui wondered, turning his body and heading towards the cracked穿衣镜.\n\nAfter a few steps, he saw a medium-built man with black hair, brown eyes, and a scholarly air clearly reflected in the mirror.\n\nIs this me, Cai Lian. Mo Lei Ti?\n\nZhou Mingrui froze, partly because the lighting was dim in the middle of the night, so he couldn’t see clearly. He stepped closer, almost about to bump into the mirror.\n\nUnder the faint, gauzy moonlight, he tilted his head to check the side of his forehead.\n\nThe mirror reflected him clearly: a狰狞 wound marred his temple, with burn marks around the edges, and blood smeared all around."}
{"chapter_index": 2, "title": "第2章 情况", "baseline_translation": "\n**Chapter 2: The Situation**\n\n*Thump, thump, thump!*\n\nZhou Mingri stumbled backward several steps, nearly tripping over his own feet, his heart pounding like a drum. The figure reflected in the mirror before him wasn’t himself—it looked more like a dried-up corpse. A man with such grievous injuries could not possibly be alive!\n\nHe tilted his head to the side, unable to believe what he was seeing, and checked the other side of the mirror. Even with the increased distance and slightly blurred reflection, the贯穿 wound and the crimson bloodstains were unmistakable.\n\n“Wha—”\n\nZhou Mingri took a deep breath, forcing himself to calm down. He reached out and pressed his hand firmly against his left chest, feeling the powerful, rapid, yet vital beat of his heart. Then, he touched the exposed skin, noting a faint coolness beneath a warm, flowing heat. He crouched down, testing the flexibility of his knees, and then stood up again, the initial panic subsiding slightly.\n\n“What’s going on?” He frowned, his voice low as he decided to carefully examine the wound on his head once more.\n\nTaking two steps forward, he paused suddenly. The light from the blood moon outside was too dim to allow for a thorough inspection. A fragment of memory surged to the forefront, and Zhou Mingri turned his head toward the wall lamp beside his desk, encased in gray pipes and metal grilles.\n\nThis was the current mainstream gas lamp, with a stable flame and excellent illumination. Given the circumstances of his brother, Kaelen Morty, it was unlikely that their family could even afford an oil lamp, let alone a gas lamp. Candles were the expected standard for their social standing. However, four years prior, while Zhou Mingri had stayed up late studying for the Hoy University entrance exams, his brother, Ban Shen, had insisted on installing the gas line. Ban Shen, a literate and employed man, was far from reckless or impulsive; he had convinced their landlord by arguing that gas lines would elevate the apartment’s prestige and make it more rentable in the future. Zhou Mingri himself had secured a nearly cost-price gas lamp through his job at an import-export company, all without borrowing money, using only his savings.\n\nThe memory fragment flickered past, and Zhou Mingri returned to his desk. He opened the gas valve and twisted the lamp switch. *Click, click, click.* But the expected light did not appear. He twisted the switch again, *click, click, click,* but the gas lamp remained dim.\n\n“Hmm…” He withdrew his hand, pressed his left temple, and drew upon the fragmented memory, searching for the cause of the issue.\n\nAfter a few seconds, he turned his body and walked over to the door, heading toward the mechanical device on the wall next to it, connected by the same gray pipes. It was a gas meter!\n\nGlancing at the exposed gears and bearings, Zhou Mingri reached into his trouser pocket and pulled out a coin. It was a dull yellow, with a sheen of copper, featuring a crowned man’s portrait on one side and the letter “1” surrounded by wheat stalks on the other. Zhou Mingri knew this was the basic currency of the Luun Kingdom, called a copper penny. One penny had roughly the purchasing power of three or four yuan before his arrival in this world. Pennies were available in denominations of five, half, and quarter pennies, but the system was still crude. People often had to round up to purchase items.\n\nAfter flipping the King George III penny in his fingers a few times, Zhou Mingri pinched it and inserted it into the vertical, slit-like “mouth” of the gas meter.\n\n*Clatter, clatter!*\n\nAs the penny fell into the meter, the sound of gears engaging echoed, playing a short, melodious mechanical tune.\n\nZhou Mingri stared for a few seconds, then returned to his desk and twisted the gas lamp switch again.\n\n*Click, click, click.* *Pop!*\n\nA flame sprang to life, quickly growing larger. Bright light filled the lampshade and spilled through the glass, casting a warm glow over the room.\n\nThe darkness receded abruptly, the blood moon receding from the windows. Zhou Mingri felt a strange sense of reassurance. He quickly walked to the mirror.\n\nThis time, he examined his temple carefully, scrutinizing every detail. After comparing several times, he noticed that apart from the initial bloodstains, the gruesome wound hadn’t oozed any more liquid. It seemed to have been expertly stopped and bandaged. Meanwhile, the slowly pulsating gray brain and the visibly growing flesh around the wound signaled the beginning of the healing process. It might take anywhere from thirty to forty minutes, or perhaps two or three hours, but eventually, only faint traces would remain.\n\n“Is it the healing effect from the transmigration?” Zhou Mingri raised the corner of his mouth in a slight smirk, whispering to himself.\n\nHe let out a long sigh. Regardless of the cause, he was still alive!\n\nCentering himself, he pulled out a small bar of soap from a drawer and took a worn towel hanging beside the cabinet. He then opened the door and headed to the second-floor communal bathroom for the tenants.\n\nHmm, the blood on his head needed to be cleaned up. He didn’t want to look like a crime scene, scaring himself one thing, but scaring his sister, Melissa, who had to get up early tomorrow, would be a disaster.\n\nThe hallway outside was pitch black, only the faint crimson moonlight filtering through the end window barely outlining the shapes of objects, making them resemble countless monster eyes silently watching the living in the depths of the night.\n\nZhou Mingri moved quietly, his heart pounding nervously as he approached the bathroom.\n\nOnce inside, the moonlight was stronger, illuminating everything clearly. He stood before the sink and turned on the faucet.\n\n*Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.*\n\nThe sound of running water suddenly reminded him of their landlord, Mr. Franz. Because water fees were included in the rent, the short, stout, thin, and always-dapper Mr. Franz, who wore a bowler hat, a waistcoat, and a black suit, frequently inspected the bathrooms, listening for the sound of running water.\n\nIf the noise was too loud, Mr. Franz would disregard his gentlemanly demeanor, furiously brandish his walking stick, and shout, “Damn thieves!” “Waste is shameful!” “I’ll remember you!” “If I catch you doing this again, you’ll leave with your dirty belongings!” “Trust me, this is the most cost-effective apartment in Tingrin City. You won’t find a more generous landlord than me!”\n\nShaking off the thought, Zhou Mingri wet the towel and began wiping the blood off his face, repeatedly.\n\nAfter checking himself in the dilapidated bathroom mirror, confirming that only the gruesome wound and pale face remained, Zhou Mingri felt a bit lighter. He then removed his linen shirt and used the soap to scrub the bloodstains.\n\nJust then, his brow furrowed as a new worry surfaced: The wound was dramatic, the bloodstains numerous. Besides himself, there should be traces in the room!\n\nAfter a few minutes, Zhou Mingri finished cleaning his shirt and hurried back home with the wet towel. He first wiped the bloodstains from his hands on the desk, then, relying on the gas lamp’s light, searched for any other traces.\n\nHis search revealed numerous blood splatters on the floor and under the desk, and near the left wall, he found a shiny bullet casing.\n\n“…Did he shoot himself in the head with a revolver?” The clues suddenly connected, and Zhou Mingri guessed the cause of Kaelen’s death.\n\nHe didn’t rush to verify it immediately. First, he meticulously cleaned the bloodstains, tidied up the “crime scene,” and then retrieved the bullet casing, returning to the desk. He opened the revolver’s cylinder and dumped out the bullets inside.\n\n*Click, click, click.* There were five bullets and one empty casing, all gleaming with brass.\n\n“Indeed…” Zhou Mingri glanced at the empty casing, nodding slightly as he carefully reloaded the bullets into the cylinder.\n\nHis gaze shifted left to the notebook lying open, where the words “Everyone will die, including me” were written. More questions flooded his mind.\n\nWhere did the gun come from?\n\nWas it a suicide or a staged suicide?\n\nWhat kind of trouble could a history graduate from a commoner family get into?\n\nHow did this method of suicide leave so little blood? Was it because he had arrived in time, possessing some kind of healing ability?\n\nHe pondered for a moment, then changed into another linen shirt and sat down in his chair, focusing on more pressing matters.\n\nKaelen’s situation wasn’t the main concern right now. The real issue was figuring out why he had transmigrated and whether he could return.\n\nHis parents, relatives, close friends, the vibrant online world, the variety of delicious food… All of these fueled his desperate desire to go back.\n\n*Click, click, click…*\n\nZhou Mingri absentmindedly spun the revolver’s cylinder in his right hand, then recocked it, repeating the motion.\n\n“Hmm, things haven’t been much different lately, except for being a bit unlucky. How did I suddenly transmigrate without any warning?”\n\n“Unlucky… Wait, I performed a luck-changing ritual before dinner tonight!”\n\nA bolt of lightning struck through Zhou Mingri’s mind, illuminating the foggy memories he had been trying to suppress.\n\nAs a self-proclaimed “somewhat knowledgeable” expert in keyboard politics, history, economics, biology, and folklore, he was often teased by his friends for being “only somewhat knowledgeable” in each.\n\nAmong these was the practice of feng shui and divination.\n\nLast year, on a trip back home, he had stumbled upon an old, bound book titled “Secrets of Qin and Han Alchemy and Divination Techniques” at a used book stall. Finding it intriguing and thinking it would help him appear more knowledgeable online, he had bought it. Unfortunately, his interest faded quickly; the vertical text was difficult to read, and he only flipped through the beginning before abandoning the book in a corner.\n\nNow, after a string of bad luck—losing his phone, a client backing out, a work mistake—when misfortunes seemed to come one after another, he had randomly remembered the luck-changing ritual mentioned at the start of the book. The ritual required nothing but basic materials.\n\nWith no cost involved, he had retrieved the book and performed the ritual before dinner. But nothing had happened at the time.\n\nYet, that night, he had transmigrated!\n\nHe had *transmigrated*!\n\n“It’s possible that ritual was the cause… Well, I’ll try it here tomorrow. If it really was that, then there’s hope I can return!”\n\nZhou Mingri stopped spinning the revolver and sat up straight.\n\nNo matter what, he had to try!\n\nEven a dead horse was worth treating as if it were still alive!"}
{"chapter_index": 3, "title": "第3章 梅丽莎", "baseline_translation": "\n**Chapter 3: Melissa**\n\nWith the plan confirmed, Zhou Mingrui found his anchor, and the fear, hesitation, and unease that had cornered themselves were finally pushed aside. Only then did he have the mental space to carefully examine the fragmented memories left by Cullen.\n\nHabituating himself, Zhou Mingrui stood up, shut off the pipe valve, watched the wall lamp fade and extinguish, then sat back down. His fingers unconsciously stroked the brass cylinder of the revolver as he pressed his temple, quietly \"tasting\" the aftermath in the crimson-darkened gloom, like the most attentive audience in a cinema.\n\nPossibly influenced by the bullet passing through him, Cullen's memories were like shattered glass – not only disjointed, but many parts were conspicuously missing. For instance, the origin of the finely crafted revolver, whether it was a suicide or murder, and the meaning behind the notebook entry \"Everyone dies, including me.\" He also wondered if he had participated in any strange events in the days leading up to the incident.\n\nNot just these specific recollections were fragmented and incomplete; even the acquired knowledge was deficient. In his current state, Zhou Mingrui believed that if Cullen were to return to university, he probably wouldn't graduate. Despite having only been away from campus for a few days and maintaining a rigorous self-discipline.\n\n_\"Two days later, I have to attend the history department interview at Tinggan University...\"_\n\n_\"The Ruin Kingdom's universities have a tradition of not directly hiring graduates... The mentor provided recommendation letters for both Tinggan University and Bekland University...\"_\n\n...\n\nLost in this silent \"viewing,\" Zhou Mingrui didn't notice the red moon sinking in the west, gradually descending until a faint light appeared in the east, dyeing the horizon gold. Inside the room, a stir was heard, followed quickly by footsteps approaching the isolation door.\n\n_\"Melissa woke up... She's as punctual as ever.\"_ Zhou Mingrui offered a subtle smile, influenced by Cullen's memories, seeing Melissa as if she were his own younger sister.\n\nBut I don't actually have a younger sister... He immediately muttered a self-deprecating remark.\n\nMelissa was different from both Cullen and Benson. Her primary education wasn't completed at the Night女神 Church's Sunday School. By the time she reached school age, the Ruin Kingdom had enacted the \"Elementary Education Act,\" establishing a low-to-middle education committee and allocating specific funding to increase investment.\n\nWithin three years, following the integration of numerous church-run schools, a multitude of public elementary schools were established. Strictly adhering to the principle of religious neutrality, they avoided entanglement in disputes involving the Storm Lord, Night女神, and the Church of Steam and Machinery.\n\nCompared to the Sunday Schools costing just one penny per week, the public elementary schools' tuition of three pence weekly seemed quite expensive. However, the former only operated once a week on Sundays, while the latter required six full days of schooling per week. Overall, the Sunday School's price was nearly free.\n\nMelissa, unlike most girls, had always been fascinated by gears, springs, and bearings, aspiring to become a steam mechanic. Aware of the educational disadvantage she herself had faced, her elder brother Benson, who understood the importance of education, supported Melissa's dream much like he had Cullen's university education. After all, Tinggan Technical School was only considered secondary education, so further schooling at a grammar school or public school wasn't necessary.\n\nLast July, at fifteen years old, Melissa passed the entrance examination and, as wished, became a student in the Steam and Mechanics department at Tinggan Technical School, with the weekly tuition increasing to nine pence.\n\nAround the same time, however, the company Benson worked for, an import-export firm, suffered a significant decline in both profits and business volume due to the Southlands' instability. This forced the company to lay off over a third of its staff. To keep his job and maintain their livelihood, Benson could only accept heavier workloads, often requiring overtime or frequent business trips to harsh environments, just like these past few days.\n\nCullen hadn't failed to consider helping his brother shoulder the burden, but as a commoner and a product of a regular grammar school, he felt acutely aware of his shortcomings from the moment he entered university. For instance, Old Fasak, the foundational language of the North大陸's nations, was a subject taught from childhood to noble heirs and wealthy children. Cullen only encountered it for the first time during university.\n\nSimilar deficiencies were widespread. Cullen had to push himself relentlessly, often pulling all-nighters, to勉强 keep up and graduate with average grades.\n\nThe memories of his brother and sister swirled in Zhou Mingrui's mind, until the turning of the handle brought him back to reality. He realized he was still holding a revolver in his hand.\n\nThis was a semi-controlled item!\n\nIt could scare a child!\n\nAnd what about the wound on his head!\n\nJust as Melissa was about to step out, Zhou Mingrui pressed his temple and hastily pulled open the desk drawer, tossing the revolver inside with a *clunk*.\n\n_\"What's wrong?\"_ Melissa asked, her gaze filled with curiosity.\n\nThough not well-nourished, she was still at the peak of her youth. Her face, though thin and slightly pale, retained a healthy glow, radiating a youthful spirit.\n\nMeeting her brown eyes fixedly upon him, Zhou Mingrui forced calm, picking up the items near his hand, then smoothly closed the drawer, concealing the revolver. The sensation of his fingers on his temple confirmed that the wound had healed!\n\nFrom the drawer, he pulled out a silver-white pocket watch adorned with vine and leaf patterns. Pressing the top gently opened the cover.\n\nIt was the most valuable item left by their father, the Royal Army Sergeant, but as a second-hand piece, it inevitably had issues. Even after repairs by a watchmaker, it remained unreliable, often causing embarrassment for Benson, who liked wearing it to elevate his status. Eventually, it was left behind in the family home.\n\nOne cannot deny that Melissa might truly possess mechanical talent. After mastering the theoretical knowledge, she began experimenting with the tools from Tinggan Technical School to fix the pocket watch. Recently, she even claimed to have successfully repaired it!\n\nAs the cover snapped open, Zhou Mingrui noticed the second hand was stuck. He instinctively twisted the crown, hoping to wind the mechanism, but no click of a tightened mainspring echoed, and the second hand remained motionless.\n\n_\"Seems like it broke again.\"_ He said, making conversation with his sister.\n\nMelissa glanced at him without expression, then quickly approached, snatching the pocket watch.\n\nStanding still, she first pulled up the crown's button, twisting it only a few turns before the ticking sound of the second hand began.\n\nNormally, pulling the crown shouldn't advance the time... Zhou Mingrui's expression froze.\n\nAt that moment, the distant cathedral bells rang out, six deep, resonant chimes.\n\nMelissa listened intently, then pushed the crown higher, twisting it continuously to set the time.\n\n_\"Done.\"_ She stated briefly, without any emotion, then pushed the crown back, handing the watch to Zhou Mingrui.\n\nZhou Mingrui offered a尴尬而不失礼貌的 smile in return.\n\nMelissa cast one last look at her brother, turned, and walked towards the cabinet, picking up her toothbrush, towel, and other items before pulling the door open to head to the shared restroom.\n\n_\"Was her expression earlier a mix of嫌弃 and resignation?\"_\n\n_\"The look of affection towards a disabled brother?\"_\n\nZhou Mingrui shook his head, chuckling softly. He snapped the cover shut with a *click*, then opened it again with a *pop*.\n\nEngaging in this repetitive motion, his thoughts wandered to a question.\n\nWithout a silencer, Cullen's suicide – let's call it suicide for now – must have made considerable noise. Yet Melissa, separated by only a wall, hadn't noticed a thing.\n\nWas she too deeply asleep? Or was the act of Cullen's suicide inherently strange?\n\n*Click*, open. *Tap*, close... Melissa returned from her wash, witnessing her brother's unconscious, repetitive opening and closing of the watch cover.\n\nHer gaze once again clouded with resignation. Her voice sweet as honey, she said:\n\n_\"Cullen, take out the remaining bread. Remember to buy fresh ones today. Also, some meat and peas. You're heading to the interview soon, so I'll make you pea stew with lamb.\"_\n\nAs she spoke, she pulled the stove from the corner, lit a fire with the remaining embers, and boiled a pot of water.\n\nJust before it boiled, she opened the bottom drawer of the cabinet, carefully pulling out a can of inferior tea leaves. Sprinkling about ten leaves into the pot, she pretended it was genuine tea.\n\nPouring two large cups, Melissa and Zhou Mingrui shared two black rye breads with the tea.\n\nNo wood shavings mixed in, not too much麸质, but still... not very good. Zhou Mingrui, weakened and hungry, forced himself to swallow the breads, criticizing internally while relying on the tea.\n\nA few minutes later, Melissa finished, tidied her black hair, and looked at Zhou Mingrui.\n\n_\"Remember to buy new bread, just eight pounds. It's hot, so too much will spoil. Also, lamb and peas. Don't forget!\"_\n\nTypical sibling care for a bookworm, even if she emphasized it... Zhou Mingrui smiled and nodded.\n\n_\"I will.\"_\n\nRegarding the Ruin Kingdom's pound, Zhou Mingrui, comparing it to Cullen's memory of the meat measurement and his own understanding, estimated it to be roughly equivalent to what he was used to, about half a kilogram.\n\nMelissa said no more, got up, tidied up, packed the last bread for lunch, put on her late mother's worn-out veil, and picked up her own knapsack, prepared with books, stationery, and other school supplies, ready to leave.\n\nToday wasn't Sunday; she had to attend school for the whole day.\n\nWalking from this apartment to Tinggan Technical School took about fifty minutes. There were public horse-drawn carriages, costing one penny per kilometer, with a maximum of four pence within the city limits and six pence for the suburbs. To save money, Melissa always left early and walked.\n\nJust as she opened the door, she paused, half-turning.\n\n_\"Cullen, don't buy too much lamb and peas. Benson might not be back until Sunday. Also, just eight pounds of bread.\"_\n\n_\"Alright, alright.\"_ Zhou Mingrui replied helplessly.\n\nAt the same time, he silently repeated the word \"Sunday\" several times in his mind.\n\nIn the North大陸, the year is divided into twelve months, ranging from 365 to 366 days. A week still consists of seven days.\n\nThe former is a result of astronomical observation, making Zhou Mingrui suspect this might be a parallel world. The latter stems from religion, as the North大陸 recognizes seven major deities: Eternal Sun, Lord of Storms, God of Knowledge and Wisdom, Night女神, Goddess of the Earth, God of War, and God of Steam and Machinery.\n\nWatching Melissa close the door and leave, Zhou Mingrui let out a sigh, quickly shifting his focus back to the ritual transfer.\n\nSorry, I truly wish to go home..."}
{"chapter_index": 4, "title": "第4章 占卜", "baseline_translation": "\n**Chapter 4: Divination**\n\nHe sank back into his chair. It wasn't until the distant church bell tolled seven times, echoing through the air, that Zhou Mingri finally rose slowly, walked over to the cabinet, and took out his clothes.\n\nA black waistcoat, trousers that fit snugly around the ankles, a low-crowned top hat, and a faint scholarly air combined to make Zhou Mingri feel as if he were watching a Victorian-era British drama when he looked at himself in the mirror.\n\n\"I'm not going for an interview,\" he muttered to himself, shaking his head and chuckling at his own expense. \"I'm just buying some groceries to prepare for a ritual to change my fortune...\"\n\nClayen's eagerness for the upcoming interview had become so ingrained in him that it had turned into an instinct. Whenever his focus wavered, he unconsciously slipped into this one set of decent attire.\n\nHe took a deep breath, removed the suit and waistcoat, and put on an old, tawny-brown coat. His headwear also changed, now a matching low-crowned felt hat.\n\nAfter tidying himself up, he walked over to the bunk bed, lifted the mat on top, and reached down through an inconspicuous tear in the fabric at the bottom to search the hidden compartment.\n\nWhen his right hand pulled back, a roll of banknotes was in his palm, about seven notes in total, their color a dark, almost bluish-green.\n\nThis was all that Banse had saved up to that point, including the living expenses for these past three days. There were only two five-syllar notes among them, the rest being one-syllar bills.\n\nIn the currency system of the Ruin Kingdom, the Syllar was the second tier, originating from ancient silver coins. One Syllar was equal to twelve copper pennies, and there were one-syllar and five-syllar denominations.\n\nAt the top of the monetary scale were Gold Pounds, also paper notes but backed by gold and directly linked to it. One Gold Pound was equivalent to twenty Syllars, with denominations of one, five, and ten.\n\nZhou Mingri unfolded the notes, catching a faint, peculiar scent of special ink.\n\nThis was the smell of money.\n\nPerhaps it was influenced by fragments of Clayen's memories, or maybe it was simply his unchanging desire for wealth, but at that moment, Zhou Mingri found himself loving these little notes.\n\nLook, the designs on them were so exquisite that even King George III, with his trimmed beard and stern demeanor, seemed endearing...\n\nLook, the watermark visible through the sunlight was so tempting, and the carefully designed anti-counterfeiting labels made it stand out distinctly from its fake counterparts!\n\nAppreciating them for nearly half a minute, Zhou Mingri pulled out two one-syllar notes, rolled the remaining ones back up, and tucked them back into the hidden compartment under the mat.\n\nHe smoothed out the fabric around the tear, neatly folded the two one-syllar notes, and put them in the left pocket of his tawny-brown coat. The few pennies in his trouser pocket were kept separate.\n\nWith that done, he slipped the key into his right pocket, picked up the large brown paper bag, and hurried towards the door.\n\nTap-tap, the footsteps quickened then slowed, finally coming to a halt.\n\nZhou Mingri stood by the door, his brow furrowed without him even realizing it.\n\nClayen's suicide left many questions unanswered. If he just went out like this, would he encounter some \"accident\"?\n\nAfter pondering for a moment, Zhou Mingri returned to the desk, opened a drawer, and took out a revolver, its brass gleaming.\n\nThis was the only defensive weapon he could think of, and a powerful one at that!\n\nAlthough he had never practiced shooting, just pulling out this pistol should be enough to intimidate someone!\n\nHe ran his fingers over the cold metal cylinder, then stuffed the gun into the pocket with the money, clenching the banknotes in his palm and pressing firmly on the grip, perfectly concealing it.\n\nA sense of security washed over him. Suddenly, a worry surfaced in his mind:\n\n\"Won't I accidentally fire it?\"\n\nAs thoughts raced through his mind, Zhou Mingri quickly found a solution. He drew the pistol, spun the cylinder to the left, positioning the chamber that was left empty due to \"suicide\" into the ready position, then snapped it shut with a click.\n\nThis way, even if there was an accidental discharge, it would be a \"dud\"!\n\nAfter reinserting the gun, Zhou Mingri kept his left hand in the pocket, no longer taking it out.\n\nHe patted his hat with his right hand and opened the door, stepping out with a resounding *thump*.\n\nThe corridor was still dimly lit during the day, with limited sunlight filtering through the end windows. Zhou Mingri hurried down the stairs, left the apartment, and only then felt the warmth and brightness of the outside.\n\nAlthough it was near July, the height of summer, Tynemouth, located in the northern part of the Ruin Kingdom, had a unique climate. The highest temperature in a year barely reached what was considered 30 degrees Celsius on Earth. The mornings were cool, but some parts of the streets were littered with dirty water and discarded trash. In Clayen's memories, such scenes were not uncommon in areas inhabited by the lower-income classes, even if they had sewers, because of the high population density and the realities of their lives.\n\n\"Come on, come on, delicious pan-fried meat and fish!\"  \n\"Fresh oysters, hot and fresh, drink a bowl in the morning and you'll be energized all day!\"  \n\"Fresh fish from the port, just five pennies a piece!\"  \n\"Small scones, Mackerel soup with ginger beer!\"  \n\"Scallops, scallops, scallops!\"  \n\"Fresh vegetables just picked from the farms outside the city, cheap and fresh!\"  \n\n...\n\nStreet vendors selling vegetables, fruits, and prepared foods shouted out their pitches, calling out to the hurried passersby. Some would stop to carefully compare and choose, while others would grow impatient and wave them away, as they hadn't secured any work yet for the day.\n\nZhou Mingri smelled a mixture of foul and enticing odors in the air, his left hand firmly gripping the gun handle, clutching the banknotes in his palm, and his right hand pressing down on his round-crowned felt hat. He bent his head slightly, lowered his gaze, and pushed through the bustling street.\n\nThieves thrived in crowded places, especially in this district where many half-unemployed people did odd jobs, and hungry children were often used as errand runners.\n\nAs they walked, when the density of the crowd returned to normal, Zhou Mingri straightened his back, lifted his head, and looked around the street.\n\nA street musician was playing the accordion nearby, his melody sometimes melancholic, sometimes passionate.\n\nBeside him, a crowd had gathered around some ragged children whose faces were蜡黄 (wan) due to malnutrition.\n\nThey listened to the music, moved to the rhythm, and instinctively twisted their bodies, dancing their own improvised steps. Their faces were filled with joy, as if they were little princes or angels.\n\nA woman with a blank expression walked past, her skirt dirty, her skin dull. Her eyes were wooden and vacant, but a faint spark appeared when she looked at the children, as if seeing a version of herself from thirty years ago.\n\nZhou Mingri passed her, turned down another street, and stopped in front of \"Stirling Bakery.\"\n\nThe owner of the bakery was an elderly woman in her seventies, named Wendyslin. Her hair was completely gray and white, and she always wore a gentle smile. Since Clayen had memories of her, she had been selling bread and pastries here.\n\nHmm, her Tynemouth pies and lemon cakes were delicious... Zhou Mingri swallowed, smiling and said, \"Madam Stirling, one pound eighteen-ounces of rye bread.\"\n\n\"Oh, little Clayen, where's Banse? Not back yet?\" Wendyslin asked with a smile.\n\n\"Still a few days,\" Zhou Mingri vaguely replied.\n\nAs she portioned out the rye bread, Wendyslin sighed and remarked, \"He's such a hardworking young man, he'll find a good wife.\" Her lips twitched up, showing a playful smile. \"Now it's better, you've graduated. You're our History Department graduate from Tynemouth University~ Well, you'll earn your money soon. You shouldn't live in such an apartment. At least you should have your own bathroom.\"\n\n\"Madam Stirling, you look like a young and lively woman today,\" Zhou Mingri could only respond with a nervous chuckle.\n\nIf Clayen could successfully pass the interview and become a lecturer at Tynemouth University, the entire family would indeed be heading towards a comfortable middle-class life!\n\nIn his fragmented memories, he had even fantasized about renting a standalone house in a more suburban area, with five or six rooms upstairs, two bathrooms, a large balcony, two rooms downstairs, a dining room, a living room, a kitchen, another bathroom, and a basement storage room.\n\nThis wasn't a dream. Even an intern-level lecturer at Tynemouth University earned a weekly salary of two Gold Pounds, and upon full-time employment, it was three Gold Pounds and ten Syllars. Knowing that Clayen's older brother Banse had worked for years and still only earned one Gold Pound and ten Syllars weekly, while ordinary factory workers often earned less than one Pound or just a little more, Zhou Mingri knew that such a house could rent for between nineteen Syllars and one Gold Pound eighteen Syllars.\n\n\"This is the difference between earning three or four thousand Syllars monthly versus eleven or twelve thousand Syllars...\" Zhou Mingri muttered to himself.\n\nHowever, all this depended on passing the interview at Tynemouth or Beckland University.\n\nAs for other paths, without connections, one couldn't secure a recommendation to become a civil servant, and for someone studying history, the job prospects were even narrower, as private advisors for nobles or bankers and industrial magnates weren't in high demand.\n\nConsidering that Clayen's knowledge had turned into \"fragments,\" incomplete and often missing pieces, Zhou Mingri felt a mix of awkwardness and guilt about his expectations for Mrs. Stirling.\n\n\"No, I've always been young at heart,\" Wendyslin humorously replied.\n\nAs she weighed out sixteen loaves of rye bread and placed them into Zhou Mingri's large brown paper bag, she held up her right hand and said, \"Nine pennies.\"\n\nEach loaf of rye bread weighed around half a pound, and there was inevitably some variation.\n\n\"Nine pennies? Wasn't it eleven pennies just two days ago?\" Zhou Mingri asked instinctively.\n\nAnd the month before that, it was fifteen pennies.\n\n\"You should thank the repeal of the **Grain Act** and the people who protested,\" Wendyslin said with her hands held out, smiling.\n\nZhou Mingri nodded vaguely, not fully understanding, though his memories of the **Grain Act** were somewhat fragmented. He only remembered that its core was to protect the price of domestic agricultural products, preventing the import of grain and cereal from southern countries like Fenwport, Masquerade, and Lumberg until prices reached a certain level.\n\nWhy would people protest against it?\n\nWithout saying more, Zhou Mingri was worried about carrying the revolver, so he carefully took out the banknotes, handed one of them to Mrs. Stirling, and put the change—three copper pennies—into his pocket. Then, he carried the bag of bread towards the \"Lettuce and Meat\" market across the street, determined to get the lamb stew with tender peas his sister had asked for.\n\nAt the intersection of Iron Cross Street and the Lilies Street, there was a town square bustling with activity. Numerous tents had been set up, and strange, amusing clowns were handing out flyers everywhere.\n\n\"Tomorrow night, circus performance?\" Zhou Mingri glanced at the flyers in others' hands and whispered the gist of the content.\n\nMelissa would definitely like it. He wondered how much the tickets would cost. A thought struck him, and he moved closer.\n\nJust as he was about to ask one of the red-and-yellow clowns, a hoarse female voice came from beside him:\n\n\"Want a divination?\"\n\nTurning his head instinctively, Zhou Mingri saw a woman wearing a pointed hat and a black long skirt standing in front of a low tent. Her face was painted with red and yellow grease, and her eyes were a deep, gray-blue color.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Mingri shook his head, he didn't have the spare money for divination.\n\nThe woman smiled. \"My Tarot readings are very accurate.\"\n\n\"Tarot...\" Zhou Mingri froze.\n\nThis pronunciation was very similar to the Tarot cards on Earth!\n\nAnd on Earth, Tarot cards were a form of fortune-telling cards, except they had additional 'symbolic figure cards'.\n\nWait a minute... he suddenly recalled the origin of Tarot divination in this world.\n\nIt wasn't derived from the seven orthodox deities, nor was it an ancient relic. Instead, it was invented over one hundred seventy years ago by then-President of the Indis Republic, Rosier Gustav.\n\nThis Mr. Rosier invented the steam engine, improved the sailboat, overthrew the rule of the Indis Kingdom, and gained recognition from the Church of the Craftsman God, becoming the first President of the new republic.\n\nLater, he campaigned across the north and south, incorporating countries like Lumberg under his protection, making northern continent powers like the Ruin Kingdom, Fenwport, and Fasack Empire bow to him. He then reformed the republic into an empire, styling himself 'Caesar the Great'.\n\nIt was during Rosier's rule that the Church of the Craftsman God received its first public revelation since the Fifth Era, changing the deity's name to the 'God of Steam and Machinery'.\n\nRosier also invented Tarot divination, establishing the current composition and gameplay of the cards. Among them were several familiar types, like Whist, Hearts, Texas Hold'em, and Quart... \n\nAdditionally, he sent fleets through the storms and chaos to discover a route to the southern continent, opening the era of colonization.\n\nUnfortunately, in his old age, he was betrayed, and in the year 1198 of the Fifth Era, he was assassinated by the Eternal Sun Church, the Solon family of the original Indis royal bloodline, and other nobles, dying in the White Maple Palace.\n\nThis... recalling these common facts suddenly made Zhou Mingri feel a toothache.\n\nCould this woman be a fellow traveler from another world?\n\nWith that thought, Zhou Mingri decided to take a look at the Tarot cards here. He nodded to the woman wearing the pointed hat and face paint, saying, \"If not... well, if the price is reasonable, I'll try.\"\n\nThe woman immediately smiled. \"Sir, you're the first person to come for a divination today. It's free.\""}
{"chapter_index": 5, "title": "第5章 仪式", "baseline_translation": "\n### Chapter 5: The Ritual\n\nFree? Free things are the most expensive! Zhou Mingrui muttered under his breath, determined to refuse any additional services that might come his way.\n\nIf you can't even divine that I'm a time traveler, then what good are your skills?\n\nWith that thought, he followed the woman with red and yellow face paint into the low tent, bending down to enter.\n\nInside, the tent was pitch black, with only a faint bit of light filtering in, barely enough to illuminate a table covered in tarot cards.\n\nThe woman, wearing a pointed hat, was completely unfazed. Her black skirt flowed like water around the table as she sat opposite him and lit a candle.\n\nThe flickering, dim light cast the tent in shades of light and shadow, instantly adding an air of mystery.\n\nZhou Mingrui sat down without a sound, his gaze sweeping over the tarot cards on the table. He recognized familiar major arcana cards like The Magician, The Emperor, The Hanged Man, and Temperance.\n\n\"Comrade Luoser could really be 'the elder'... I wonder if he's from my home country, the Great Eater Empire...\" Zhou Mingrui moved his lips slightly, a dizzying thought crossing his mind.\n\nHe hadn’t had time to examine all the cards laid out on the table when the woman, who claimed her divinations were incredibly accurate, already reached out and gathered all the tarot cards together, stacking them into a pile and pushing it toward him.\n\n\"You wash and cut the cards,\" the circus fortune-teller said in a low, hoarse voice.\n\n\"I wash them?\" Zhou Mingrui asked instinctively.\n\nThe fortune-teller’s red and yellow face paint seemed to shift as she revealed a faint smile.\n\n\"Of course. Only you can divine your own fate; I’m just an interpreter.\"\n\nZhou Mingrui immediately became wary and asked:\n\n\"Does that come with an extra charge?\"\n\nAs a keyboard folklorist, I’ve seen plenty of tricks like this!\n\nThe fortune-teller seemed taken aback for a moment before replying grudgingly:\n\n\"Free.\"\n\nHe breathed a sigh of relief, tucking his revolver a little deeper into his pocket. Then, with a calm demeanor, he extended his palms and expertly shuffled and cut the cards.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said, placing the shuffled tarot cards in the center of the table.\n\nThe fortune-teller clasped her hands together, studying the cards attentively for a moment before speaking:\n\n\"Sorry, I forgot to ask. What do you want to divine?\"\n\nBack when he was pursuing his unrequited初恋 (初恋), Zhou Mingrui had studied tarot cards. Without hesitation, he replied:\n\n\"The past, the present, and the future.\"\n\nThis was a tarot spread where three cards are laid out in sequence, representing the past, present, and future.\n\nThe fortune-teller nodded first, then her lips curved upward into a smile.\n\n\"That means you need to shuffle the cards again. You have to understand what you’re asking before you can draw cards with meaningful symbolism.\"\n\nYou were playing me earlier... Can’t you be a little generous? Was it really just because I kept emphasizing that it was free?\n\nZhou Mingrui’s facial muscles twitched slightly. He took a deep breath, retrieved the tarot cards, and reshuffled and cut them once more.\n\n\"Should be fine this time,\" he said, placing the cut cards on the table.\n\n\"Done,\" the fortune-teller said, reaching out to pick up the top card. Her voice grew even lower and huskier as she placed it to his left. \"This card represents the past.\"\n\n\"This one represents the present,\" she said, placing the second card directly in front of him.\n\nShe picked up the third card and placed it to his right.\n\n\"This one represents the future.\"\n\n\"Alright, which one do you want to see first?\" Once she finished, she lifted her head and gazed deeply into Zhou Mingrui’s eyes with her gray-blue irises.\n\n\"Let’s start with the present,\" Zhou Mingrui said after a moment’s thought.\n\nThe fortune-teller slowly nodded and turned over the card in front of him.\n\nThe card depicted a young man dressed in splendid clothes, wearing an ornate headpiece, carrying a staff over his shoulder, with luggage hanging from the top of the staff. A small dog pulled at his heels. The number \"0\" was printed on the card.\n\n\"The Fool,\" the fortune-teller whispered, her gray-blue eyes fixed on Zhou Mingrui.\n\nThe Fool? Tarot’s zeroth card? A beginning? A start that encompasses all possible beginnings?\n\nZhou Mingrui, who wasn’t even a beginner in tarot, made a rough interpretation based on his limited knowledge.\n\nJust as the fortune-teller was about to speak, the tent’s canvas door was suddenly thrown open, letting in a harsh sunlight that forced Zhou Mingrui, who was facing away, to instinctively squint.\n\n\"You’re impersonating me again! Divination is my job!\" a woman’s voice shouted angrily. \"Go back! Remember, you’re just a circus animal trainer!\"\n\nZhou Mingrui adjusted to the light and saw another woman standing in the doorway—also wearing a pointed hat, a black skirt, and red and yellow face paint, but taller and thinner.\n\nThe woman sitting opposite him stood up, looking displeased.\n\n\"Don’t mind me. I just enjoy this kind of thing. I must say, sometimes my divinations and interpretations are quite accurate. Really...\"\n\nAs she spoke, she raised her skirt and hurriedly walked around the table, disappearing into the tent.\n\n\"Sir, would you like me to interpret something for you?\" the real fortune-teller asked Zhou Mingrui with a smile.\n\nZhou Mingrui moved his lips, asking sincerely:\n\n\"Free?\"\n\n\"...No,\" the real fortune-teller replied.\n\n\"Then forget it,\" Zhou Mingrui said, sliding his hand back into his pocket, pressing the revolver and some coins. He bent down and stepped out of the tent.\n\nThis is ridiculous. Finding a circus animal trainer to do tarot divination!\n\nIf you’re not a good fortune-teller, can’t you at least be a decent clown?\n\nZhou Mingrui quickly pushed the incident aside. At the \"Lettuce and Meat\" market, he bought 1 pound of subpar lamb meat for 7 pence, along with tender peas, cabbage, onions, and potatoes. Adding the bread he’d already bought, the total cost was 25 copper pennies, or 2 shillings and 1 penny.\n\n\"Money really doesn’t last long,\" Zhou Mingrui sighed. \"Poor Benson...\"\n\nNot only had he spent the two banknotes he’d taken out, but he’d also lost a penny from his pocket.\n\nHe casually remarked this and didn’t think much more of it, hurrying back home.\n\nWith the main ingredients ready, it was time to perform the ritual for good luck!\n\n...\n\nAfter the upstairs tenants had all left, Zhou Mingrui didn’t rush to perform the ritual. Instead, he first translated the terms \"Fu Sheng Xuan Huang Xian Zun\" into ancient Fasak and Runian languages, planning to try the original spell again the next day if it didn’t work.\n\nAfter all, he had to consider the differences between the two realms and follow local customs.\n\nAs for translating it into Hermes language, which was used for ancient prayers and sacrifices, Zhou Mingrui found it difficult due to his limited vocabulary.\n\nOnce he finished, he pulled out four black rye loaves from the paper bag. One was placed in the corner where the coal stove used to be. Another was hidden beneath the bottom edge of the wardrobe. The third was tucked into the corner where the closet met the wall. The fourth was placed in a cluttered spot near his desk.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Zhou Mingrui walked to the center of the room. He paused for a few minutes to calm himself before taking a solemn step and walking in a square in a counterclockwise direction.\n\nWith his first step, he whispered:\n\n\"Fu Sheng Xuan Huang Xian Zun.\"\n\nWith his second step, he sincerely murmured:\n\n\"Fu Sheng Xuan Huang Tianjun.\"\n\nWith his third step, he held his breath and whispered:\n\n\"Fu Sheng Xuan Huang Shangdi.\"\n\nWith his fourth step, he exhaled and silently recited:\n\n\"Fu Sheng Xuan Huang Tianzun.\"\n\nAfter returning to his starting point, Zhou Mingrui closed his eyes and waited, hoping for a result. He felt a mix of anticipation, unease, hope, and fear.\n\nCould he go back?\n\nWould the ritual work?\n\nWould something unexpected happen?\n\nThe darkness before him seemed to glow with a deep red light. His thoughts raced through his mind, unable to settle.\n\nJust then, he suddenly felt as if the air around him had stopped moving, becoming thick and eerie.\n\nFollowing this, he heard whispers that were sometimes subtle, sometimes sharp, sometimes ethereal, sometimes tempting, sometimes狂躁 (frantic), sometimes疯狂 (insane). Even though he couldn’t understand the murmurs, he couldn’t help but listen and try to discern their meaning.\n\nHis head began to ache violently, as if a steel钎 (钎) had been driven into it.\n\nZhou Mingrui felt his head would burst. His thoughts were clouded with a hallucinatory haze.\n\nHe knew something was wrong. He tried desperately to open his eyes but couldn’t manage even the simplest action.\n\nHis body grew increasingly tense, as if it could snap at any moment. A self-mocking thought crossed his mind:\n\n\"Don’t provoke trouble if you don’t want to die...\"\n\nUnable to endure it any longer, just as the tension in his mind reached its breaking point, the cacophony of voices and whispers faded away, leaving an eerie silence. The atmosphere felt surreal.\n\nNot only the atmosphere, but Zhou Mingrui also felt as if his body had become similarly surreal.\n\nHe tried to open his eyes again, and this time, it was effortless.\n\nA swirling gray mist filled his vision,朦胧 (blurry), indistinct, boundless.\n\n\"What’s going on?\" Zhou Mingrui looked around in astonishment, then lowered his head and saw that he was floating on the edge of an endless gray mist.\n\nThe mist flowed like water, dotted with countless deep red \"stars.\" Some were large, some were small, some were hidden deep within, others floating on the surface.\n\nStaring at this holographic-like scene, Zhou Mingrui reached out his right hand, half in confusion, half in exploration, trying to touch one of the deep red \"stars\" floating on the surface, hoping to find a way to escape.\n\nAs his fingers brushed against the surface of the star, ripples erupted from his body, startling the \"star\" into a burst of light, like a dreamlike firework.\n\nZhou Mingrui jumped in surprise and hastily withdrew his hand. In the process, he accidentally touched another \"star.\"\n\nThat one also flared to life.\n\nZhou Mingrui felt dizzy and disoriented.\n\n...\n\nIn the luxurious villa in the Queen’s Quarter of Beckland, the capital of Runne Kingdom, Audrey Holm sat in front of the dressing table, stroking an ancient, cracked copper mirror on the table.\n\n\"Magic mirror, magic mirror, wake up...\"\n\n\"I command you in the name of the Holm family to awaken!\"\n\n...\n\nShe tried various phrases, but the mirror remained unresponsive.\n\nAfter more than ten minutes, she finally gave up, pouting in disappointment and muttering softly:\n\n\"Dad was definitely lying to me. He always tells me this mirror is a treasure from the Black Emperor of the ancient Solomon Empire, a remarkable artifact...\"\n\nBefore her words faded, the copper mirror on the table suddenly emitted a deep red glow, enveloping her instantly.\n\n...\n\nOn the Sina Sea, an outdated three-masted ship plowed through a violent storm.\n\nAlger Wilson stood on the deck, his body swaying with the ship’s movements, effortlessly maintaining his balance.\n\nDressed in a long robe embroidered with lightning patterns, he held a strangely shaped glass bottle. Bubbles occasionally churned inside, frost sometimes condensed into snow, and winds sometimes carved patterns on its surface.\n\n\"Still missing ghost shark blood...\" Alger murmured.\n\nJust then, a deep red light erupted between the bottle and his hand, instantly engulfing the surrounding area.\n\n...\n\nAbove a sea of gray and white mist, Audrey Holm’s vision returned. She looked left and right, both terrified and confused, noticing that the man with a blurred figure beside her was doing the same.\n\nThen, almost simultaneously, they both noticed a mysterious figure standing not far away, surrounded by a grayish-white mist.\n\nZhou Mingrui was equally stunned.\n\n\"Sir, where are we?\"\n\n\"What do you intend to do?\"\n\nAudrey and Alger exchanged surprised glances, falling silent for a moment before speaking in unison."}
{"chapter_index": 6, "title": "第6章 非凡者", "baseline_translation": "\n**Chapter 6: The Extraordinary**\n\nThe same Runian language, the same heavy and tense feeling.\nWhere are we? What am I supposed to do? I wonder too... Zhou Mingrui calmed down and silently repeated the two people's questions.\nWhat struck him most profoundly, however, wasn't the sentences formed by the words, nor the meaning they conveyed, but the panic, vigilance, fear, and awe displayed by the man and the woman!\nBeing inexplicably pulled into this gray mist world by the two of them, even as the \"culprit,\" Zhou Mingrui himself was unusually shocked and surprised. How much more so for them, the passive party!\nIn their eyes, this kind of thing, this kind of experience, must have surpassed their wildest imagination, right?\nIn that instant, Zhou Mingrui thought of two options. One was to pretend to be a victim myself, hide my true identity, and in doing so, gain a certain level of trust to observe the situation calmly and fish for information. The other was to maintain the mysterious and unfathomable image they saw in their eyes, take the initiative in guiding the development of events, and extract valuable information from it.\nThere was no time for further thought or probing. Zhou Mingrui seized the fleeting idea in his mind and made a swift decision, opting for the second approach.\nLeverage their current psychological state and seize the greatest advantage!\nA brief silence hung over the gray mist for a few seconds. Zhou Mingrui let out a light laugh, his tone calm and his voice low but not heavy, as if responding to a visitor's polite inquiry:\n\"A trial.\"\nA trial... A trial? Audrey Hall stared at the enigmatic man obscured by gray and white mist, finding the whole situation absurd, amusing, horrifying, and bizarre.\nOne moment, she was in her bedroom, standing before her dressing table. The next, she had \"arrived\" in this place filled with gray mist!\nHow utterly incomprehensible!\nAudrey took a breath, revealing an impeccable, polite smile, and tentatively asked:\n\"Sir, is the trial over? Can we go back now?\"\nAlgernon Wilson also considered making a similar test, but his extensive experience made him more composed. He suppressed his impulse and simply observed silently.\nZhou Mingrui looked at the questioner. Vaguely, he could discern the outline of the figure before him—a tall girl with soft, golden hair—but her specific features were unclear.\nHe didn't rush to answer the girl's question. Instead, he turned his gaze to the man on the other side. The man had unruly, sea-foam-like deep blue hair, and a medium build that wasn't particularly robust.\nAt that moment, Zhou Mingrui suddenly gained a clarity. When I become stronger, or when I understand this gray mist world more deeply, perhaps I will be able to truly see through the obscurity, to clearly perceive the appearance of the girl and the man.\nIn this incident, they were the guests, and I was the host!\nWith this shift in mindset, Zhou Mingrui immediately noticed some details he hadn't paid attention to before.\nBoth the girl with the sweet voice and the man who was calm and reserved appeared quite ethereal, tinged with a faint redness, like the projections of those two deep red \"stars\" onto the gray mist above.\nAnd this projection was based on the connection between myself and the deep red—a connection that was intangible yet could be truly grasped.\nIf this connection were severed, the projection would dissipate, and they would return... Zhou Mingrui nodded imperceptibly, turned his gaze to the golden-haired girl, and smiled softly:\n\"Of course. If you formally request it, I can send you back right now.\"\nAudrey, hearing no malice in his tone, breathed a sigh of relief. Believing that a gentleman capable of such miraculous feats would certainly uphold his promise, she didn't rush to ask for departure.\nInstead, her spirits slightly steadied, she found herself not in a hurry to leave. Her emerald eyes darted left and right, sparkling with an unusual light.\nShe spoke tentatively, yet with excitement and eagerness:\n\"This has truly been a wondrous experience... Well, I've always looked forward to something like this. I mean, I love the mysterious, the miracles that surpass nature. No, my point is—Sir, what should I do to become an Extraordinary?\"\nThe more she spoke, the more excited she became, even losing coherence in her words. The dream that had germinated from listening to elders' tales of strange legends and bizarre stories in her childhood seemed to finally have a glimmer of hope.\nIn just a few sentences, she had forgotten the fear and panic that had gripped her moments before.\nGood question! I also want to know the answer... Zhou Mingrui self-teased himself.\nHe began to think about how to respond in order to maintain an air of mystery.\nAt the same time, he felt that standing here and conversing seemed a bit low-key. In a scene like this, shouldn't there be a temple, a long table, and numerous carved, ancient-patterned, mysteriously feeling backrest chairs, with myself seated at the highest point, quietly observing the guests?\nAs soon as this thought crossed his mind, the gray mist suddenly churned, startling Audrey and Algernon.\nIn the blink of an eye, they saw towering stone columns appear around them, and a vast dome overhead.\nThe entire structure was magnificent, grand, and imposing, as if it were the throne room of a giant from legend.\nBeneath the dome, where the gray mist gathered, a bronze long table appeared, with ten high-backed chairs on either side, and similar seats placed in front and behind. On the backs of the chairs, brilliant and subdued reds shimmered, outlining strange constellations that did not correspond with reality.\nAudrey and Algernon found themselves seated directly opposite each other, in the positions closest to the head of the table.\nThe girl glanced left, then right, and couldn't help but mutter under her breath:\n\"What a marvel...\"\nIndeed, it was... Zhou Mingrui extended his right hand, lightly stroking the edge of the bronze long table with small, almost imperceptible movements, maintaining a calm facade.\nAlgernon also took in the surroundings. After a few seconds of silence, he suddenly spoke, answering Audrey's question in Zhou Mingrui's stead:\n\"You are from Luan, aren't you?\"\n\"To become an Extraordinary, join the Church of the Night Goddess, the Church of the Storm Lord, or the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery.\"\n\"Although most people never encounter an Extraordinary in their lifetime, to the point where they might even doubt the churches, and even within the major churches, some clergy share similar doubts, but I can tell you unequivocally: at the Tribunal, the Court of Judgment, the execution agencies, Extraordinary beings still exist, still fighting against the dangers that grow in the darkness. Just not nearly as many as in the early Black Iron Age or before.\"\nZhou Mingrui listened intently, but his body language deliberately conveyed an air of nonchalance, as if listening to a child's story.\nRelying on his residual historical knowledge from Cleric, he knew the \"Black Iron Age\" referred to the current era, the Fifth Era, which began thirteen hundred forty-nine years ago.\nAudrey listened quietly, then sighed and said:\n\"Sir, I know what you're saying, and even more. For example, the Night's Watch, the Penal Executioners, the Heart of Machinery. But, I don't want to lose my freedom.\"\nAlgernon let out a low chuckle, speaking vaguely:\n\"Is there really no cost to becoming an Extraordinary without considering joining a church, undergoing trials, or seeking out the royal family, noble houses with millennia of history, or perhaps stumbling upon hidden evil organizations?\"\nAudrey instinctively puffed out her cheeks, then nervously looked left and right. When she was sure the \"Mysterious Sir\" and the man opposite hadn't noticed her little action, she pressed on:\n\"Is there really no other way?\"\nAlgernon fell silent. After several breaths, he turned his head to look at the \"Mysterious Sir,\" Zhou Mingrui, who remained silent and observant.\nOnly after seeing that Zhou Mingrui wasn't objecting did he turn back to Audrey and said, carefully:\n\"I actually have two Level 9 formulas.\"\nLevel 9? Zhou Mingrui murmured to himself.\n\"Really? Which two?\" Audrey clearly knew what Level 9 formulas represented.\nAlgernon leaned back slightly, answering in a measured tone:\n\"You know, for humans to become true Extraordinary beings, they can only rely on elixirs. And the names of these elixirs come from the 'Profane Tablets,' having undergone constant translation through Giant, Elven, Ancient Hermes, Ancient Fasak, and Contemporary Hermes languages, evolving long ago to fit the times. The names aren't the key; the key is whether they represent the 'core symbol' of the elixir.\"\n\"The Level 9 formulas I have are as follows: one is called 'Sailor.' It grants you exceptional balance, allowing you to walk freely on land even during a stormy ship voyage. You'll also gain extraordinary strength and hidden scales beneath your skin, making you as slippery as a fish, agile in water like a sea creature, able to dive for at least ten minutes without any equipment.\"\n\"Sounds amazing... The 'Sea Followers' of the Storm Lord?\" Audrey asked, half in expectation, half to confirm.\n\"In ancient times, it was indeed called 'Sea Followers,'\" Algernon said without pausing. \"The second Level 9 formula is called 'Audience.' As for what it was called in ancient times, I don't know. This elixir grants you outstanding mental acuity and sharp observational skills. You've probably seen operas and plays, so you understand what 'Audience' means—it means observing like a spectator, examining the 'actors' in secular society, discerning their true thoughts from their expressions, their manners, their speech quirks, their unseen actions.\"\nAs he spoke, Algernon emphasized:\n\"You must remember, whether in lavish banquets or bustling streets, the audience is always just the audience.\"\nAudrey's eyes lit up. It took her a while to speak:\n\"Why? Well, that's a follow-up question. I... I've grown fond of this feeling, 'Audience.' How do I obtain the formula for 'Audience'? What do I trade for it?\"\nAlgernon, as if prepared, spoke in a low voice:\n\"One hundred milliliters of Ghost Shark blood.\"\nAudrey nodded excitedly first, then worriedly asked:\n\"If I can get it—meaning, if I do—how do I give it to you? And how do I ensure that once you receive the Ghost Shark blood, you'll give me the formula, and that the formula is genuine?\"\nAlgernon replied calmly:\n\"I'll give you an address. Once I receive the Ghost Shark blood, I'll send the formula back to you, or tell you here directly.\"\n\"As for ensuring its authenticity, I think with the witness of this mysterious Sir here, both you and I can feel assured.\"\nAs he said this, he turned his gaze toward Zhou Mingrui, seated at the head of the table:\n\"Sir, you brought us here, granting us power unimaginable to us. Your testimony, whether it's me or her, carries too much weight to be disobeyed.\"\n\"Exactly!\" Audrey's eyes brightened, and she agreed excitedly.\nIn her view, the mysterious Sir with seemingly unimaginable means was indeed a sufficiently \"authoritative\" witness.\nDid she and the man opposite even have the nerve to deceive him!\nAudrey turned partially in her seat, earnestly looking at Zhou Mingrui:\n\"Sir, please act as our witness for this transaction.\"\nAt that moment, she realized she had forgotten to ask a certain question, being so absorbed in the moment. Apologizing hastily, she added:\n\"Sir, how should we address you?\"\nAlgernon nodded slightly and followed suit, asking solemnly:\n\"Sir, how should we address you?\"\nZhou Mingrui paused, his fingers lightly tapping on the bronze long table. His mind flashed back to the divination content he had performed earlier.\nHe leaned back, withdrew his hand, crossed his fingers over his chin, and smiled at the two of them:\n\"You can call me...\"\nPausing there, he took a moment, his tone gentle yet plain:\n\"The Fool.\""}
{"chapter_index": 7, "title": "第7章 代号", "baseline_translation": "\n**Chapter 7: Designation**\n\n\"The name you can call me is The Fool.\"\n\nThe brief answer dissipated within the grand temple and the弥漫的雾气, but in Audrey and Argyle's hearts, that voice echoed for a long time, creating ripple after ripple.\n\nUnexpected, yet it felt right. The name perfectly embodied mystery, power, and strangeness!\n\nAfter a few seconds of silence, Audrey stood up, raised her skirt slightly, bent her knees, and bowed to Zhou Mingrui:\n\n\"Respected Mr. Fool, may I rashly request your permission to ask if you could serve as a witness to our transaction?\"\n\n\"A small matter,\" Zhou Mingrui thought rapidly, answering in a manner befitting his identity.\n\n\"It is an honor, Mr. Fool,\" Argyle also stood up, placed his right hand over his chest, bowed his head, and paid respects.\n\nZhou Mingrui lightly pressed his right hand, smiled, and opened his mouth:\n\n\"You continue.\"\n\nArgyle nodded, sat back down, and looked at Audrey:\n\n\"If you can obtain the Ghost Shark's blood, find someone to deliver it to the 'Brave and Sea' bar in Pelican Street, White Rose District, Port Priz, and tell the owner Williams that this is something 'Captain' wants.\"\n\n\"Once I confirm, will you send me the address to mail the potion recipe, or shall I tell you directly here?\"\n\nAudrey thought for a moment, then smiled:\n\n\"I choose the more confidential way. Here, although it tests my memory quite a bit.\"\n\nSince Mr. Fool agreed to witness the transaction, it meant there would be another similar \"gathering\" in the future.\n\nThinking this, she suddenly turned her head, her eyes sparkling as she looked at Zhou Mingrui, her tone full of interest:\n\n\"Mr. Fool, would you mind having more such 'experiments'?\"\n\nArgyle, having listened intently, was also moved, and quickly added:\n\n\"Mr. Fool, don't you find this kind of 'gathering' quite interesting? Although your power surpasses our imagination, there are always fields you don't know or aren't good at. That lady over there clearly comes from noble lineage, and I myself have my own experiences, knowledge, channels, and resources. Perhaps between us, we could help you accomplish some trivial tasks that are inconvenient for you to handle yourself in the future.\"\n\nIn his view, since he had been pulled into this place without any defense or resistance, it meant the initiative lay with the mysterious Mr. Fool. If he tried to refuse or wanted to stop participating in \"gatherings\" afterward, he couldn't succeed. So, it was better to delve deeper into the benefits of this encounter and gain from it, compensating for the passivity and disadvantage.\n\nThe three parties at the long table had different backgrounds, resources, information channels, and knowledge of the mysterious world. If they could exchange with each other and cooperate limitedly, the effects would be immeasurable and incomparable!\n\nFor example, the resource exchange just agreed upon. If he wanted to kill someone, he could simply ask the \"gathering members\" who had no surface or actual connection to him to help, which would perfectly misdirect the matter towards another direction.\n\nThe noble lady... was my performance noticeable? My accent so obvious? Audrey's mouth slightly opened, she froze for a moment, but quickly regained her composure and nodded without hesitation:\n\n\"Mr. Fool, I think this is a great proposal. As long as the 'gathering' becomes regular, for things where you are unwilling or unable to intervene directly, you can delegate them to us. Of course, within our capabilities.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, Zhou Mingrui had been weighing the pros and cons. More \"gatherings\" would indeed allow him to gain more extraordinary mysteries and esoteric knowledge, which would be helpful for his future return trip. For example, the potion recipe for the \"Audience\" that would likely appear at next week's \"gathering.\" Similarly, it could provide him with information for his current real life and some assistance.\n\nHowever, more \"gatherings\" also increased the risk of exposing his true self!\n\nIndeed, there were no purely beneficial things in any world...\n\nZhou Mingrui once again extended his right hand, lightly tapping the edge of the long table.\n\nConsidering that the convening and dissolution of the \"gathering\" were under his control, even if some issues were exposed, they were within a manageable scope. The benefits clearly outweighed the drawbacks, so Zhou Mingrui made his decision swiftly.\n\nHe stopped tapping, met the four expectant yet uneasy gazes, and smiled:\n\n\"I am someone who likes equal exchange.\"\n\n\"You won't ask us to help without any conditions.\"\n\n\"Starting next Monday, 3 PM, try to be alone. After I try a few more times and figure out some things, perhaps you can take leave in advance and not worry about being in an unsuitable situation.\"\n\nThis was his agreement to Argyle and Audrey's proposal.\n\nAudrey, who had just turned seventeen, had always been pampered and cherished, and as a young girl, she couldn't help but clench her fists and sway them lightly in front of her chest upon hearing Mr. Fool's response.\n\n\"So, should we also give ourselves a designation? After all, we can't use our real names to communicate,\" she said enthusiastically, before Argyle could speak.\n\nAlthough her true situation might not be hidden from Mr. Fool, the other person was also somewhat dangerous; she couldn't let him know who she really was!\n\n\"Good idea,\" Zhou Mingrui answered briefly and lightly.\n\nAudrey immediately began to think, speaking as she pondered:\n\n\"You are Mr. Fool, from the Tarot. Then, as a regular, long-term, secret 'gathering,' the designation should be as consistent as possible, right? Well, I'll also pick mine from the Tarot.\"\n\nHer tone gradually became cheerful:\n\n\"Determined! My designation is 'Justice'!\"\n\nThis was one of the twenty-two Major Arcana cards in the Tarot.\n\n\"And what about you, sir?\" Audrey asked with a smile, looking at the \"comrade\" across from her.\n\nArgyle frowned slightly, then relaxed and said:\n\n\"Suspenders.\"\n\nThis was another Major Arcana card.\n\n\"Alright, then we are the founding members of the Tarot Club!\" Audrey said happily first, then looked hesitantly at Zhou Mingrui, who was veiled in gray and white mist, \"Is that okay, Mr. Fool?\"\n\nZhou Mingrui shook his head with a smile:\n\n\"Such a small matter, you can decide for yourselves.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" Audrey was clearly very excited.\n\nThen, she looked at Argyle again:\n\n\"Suspenders, could you repeat the address, please? I'm afraid my memory isn't sharp enough.\"\n\n\"No problem,\" Argyle was quite satisfied with Audrey's seriousness and repeated the address.\n\nAfter默念了三次, Audrey said cheerfully again:\n\n\"I heard that the Tarot was actually a game invented by Emperor Rosier, and it doesn't actually have divination capabilities?\"\n\n\"No, often, divination originates from oneself. Everyone has spirituality and can sense the spirit world and information about higher-level relationships. It's just that ordinary people can't perceive this, let alone interpret the 'hints' they receive. When they use divination tools, these pieces of information are presented through the tools. A simple example is dreams and dream interpretation,\" Argyle glanced at Zhou Mingrui, saw he didn't object, and then spoke to disprove Audrey's statement. \"The Tarot actually belongs to this category of tools. It uses more symbolism and reasonable elements to help us conveniently and accurately interpret the 'hints'.\"\n\nZhou Mingrui seemed to be daydreaming, but he was listening very attentively. However, his spiritual disconnection began to worsen, and his head started to ache in spasms.\n\n\"Understood,\" Audrey nodded in agreement, then emphasized, \"I didn't mean that. I'm not questioning the Tarot. I heard that Emperor Rosier actually created another deck, a secret one, made of cards symbolizing certain unknown forces, totaling twenty-two cards. After completing that, he referred to it to invent the twenty-two Major Arcana cards of the Tarot as a game tool. Is this accurate?\"\n\nShe looked at Zhou Mingrui, seemingly wanting to get an answer from the mysterious Mr. Fool.\n\nZhou Mingrui just smiled and didn't open his mouth, his gaze shifting towards \"Suspenders,\" as if to quiz him.\n\nArgyle instinctively straightened his back and said in a low voice:\n\n\"Yes, it's said that Emperor Rosier had seen the profane tablet, and that deck of cards contained the secrets of the twenty-two divine paths.\"\n\n\"Twenty-two divine paths...\" Audrey repeated with a tone full of admiration.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Mingrui's headache intensified, and he felt the invisible connection between himself and the Scarlet Star, the gray mist, beginning to waver.\n\n\"Alright, today's gathering will end here,\" he decided immediately, speaking in a low voice.\n\n\"Obey your will,\" Argyle bowed his head in respect.\n\n\"Obey your will,\" Audrey imitated \"Suspenders.\"\n\nShe had so many questions and ideas, she couldn't bear to end it.\n\nAs he severed the connection, Zhou Mingrui smiled:\n\n\"Let's look forward to the next gathering.\"\n\nThe Scarlet Star dimmed, the red light like water receded back. Just as Audrey and Argyle heard Mr. Fool's words, his figure became increasingly blurred and ethereal.\n\nIn less than a second, the \"projection\" shattered, and silence returned to the gray mist.\n\nZhou Mingrui felt himself quickly becoming heavier, his surroundings fading away. First, darkness, then brilliant sunlight.\n\nHe was still in his apartment room, standing in the center.\n\n\"Dream-like... What exactly is that gray mist world... And who or what kind of power created that change just now... \" Zhou Mingrui muttered to himself, full of confusion. His legs felt as heavy as lead as he walked towards the desk.\n\nHe picked up the watch he had placed outside earlier, checking how much time had passed.\n\n\"A 1:1 time flow rate,\" Zhou Mingrui roughly estimated.\n\nHe put down the watch. With the intense headache, he could no longer hold on and sat down in the chair, lowering his head and using his left thumb and index finger to massage both sides of his temples.\n\nAfter a long time, he suddenly sighed, speaking in Chinese:\n\n\"It seems I can't return anytime soon...\"\n\nThe ignorant can be fearless, but after witnessing such incredible things and learning about the extraordinary realm and mysterious world, Zhou Mingrui dared not rashly attempt the \"转运仪式\" (transmigration ritual) in Old Fasack and Ruin languages anymore!\n\nWho knew what other situations might arise, perhaps even stranger and more terrifying, even life-altering!\n\n\"At least I need to master esoteric knowledge thoroughly before attempting it,\" Zhou Mingrui thought helplessly.\n\nFortunately, the so-called \"gathering\" could provide him with help.\n\nSilence fell again, and he spoke to himself, filled with frustration, disappointment, pain, and melancholy:\n\n\"From now on, I am克莱恩 (Cai Lian).\"\n\n...\n\nCai Lian made great efforts to shift his thoughts back to plans and strategies to dispel the negative emotions in his heart.\n\nNext week, perhaps he could overhear the potion recipe for the \"Audience\"... \n\nThat \"gathering\" just now was truly amazing. People from different parts of the world, turning thousands of miles into mere steps, face-to-face communication, mutual exchange... Huh, this sounded familiar...\n\nCai Lian froze for a few seconds, then burst out laughing, pressing his temple with his hand and speaking softly to himself in self-mockery:\n\n\"Let's get to know some online dating platforms?\""}
{"chapter_index": 8, "title": "第8章 新的时代", "baseline_translation": "\n**Chapter 8: A New Era**\n\n**Part 1**\n\nWah!\n\nHowling winds and torrential rain battered the three-masted ship as it surged between towering waves, tossed like a toy caught and thrown by a giant.  \nAlgernon Wilson watched as the deep red drained from his eyes, confirming he was still standing on the deck, unchanged from before.  \nThen, he saw the strangely shaped glass bottle in his hand shatter with a crisp *crack*, frost melting into water, absorbed by the raindrops.  \nIn mere seconds, the ancient artifact vanished without a trace.  \nA six-pointed, crystalline snowflake appeared in Algernon's palm, fading quickly until it disappeared, as if retracting into his flesh.  \nHe nodded almost imperceptibly, lost in thought, remaining still for five minutes.  \nTurning his body, he headed towards the cabin entrance. Just as he was about to enter, he met a man in a long robe embroidered with lightning patterns exiting.  \nThe man with soft yellow hair paused, stared at Algernon, and extended his right hand, fist clenched against his chest:  \n\"Storm with you.\"  \nAlgernon, with his rugged, profound face showing no extra emotion, mirrored the gesture, clenching his right fist against his left chest.  \nAfter exchanging formal nods, Algernon entered the cabin, walking down the corridor towards the captain's quarters.  \nThroughout his journey, he encountered no sailors or crew members, the place unnervingly silent like a tomb's interior.  \nThe captain's door opened, revealing a deep brown, plush carpet, bookshelves and a liquor cabinet on either side.  \nYellowed book covers and dark red wine bottles gleamed with an eerie light under the candle's glow.  \nOn the candlelit desk sat an inkwell, a quill, a black metal telescope, and a brass sextant.  \nBehind the desk, a middle-aged man with a pale face and a skull captain's hat watched Algernon approach, gritting his teeth in fury:  \n\"I won't surrender!\"  \n\"I believe you can.\" Algernon replied calmly, as if commenting on the weather.  \n\"You...\" the man froze, unprepared for such a response.  \nAt that moment, Algernon bent his body slightly, lunged forward, closing the distance to just the desk.  \n*Crack!*  \nHis shoulder tensed, his right hand shot out, clamping onto the man's throat.  \nNo time for reaction, translucent scales shimmered on his hand as his fingers clenched violently.  \n*Clink!*  \nWith a sharp sound, the man's eyes widened in shock as he was lifted entirely off his feet.  \nHis legs thrashed wildly but soon stilled, his pupils dilating in confusion, his crotch area growing damp, emitting a foul odor.  \nAlgernon hoisted the man, bent his waist, and kicked his legs forward, pressing him against the wall beside him.  \n*Thud!* He hurled the man forward like a shield, his arms thick as monstrous limbs.  \nThe wooden wall splintered instantly, the狂暴的风雨 carrying the briny tang sweeping in.  \nAlgernon twisted his waist and back, tossing the man out of the cabin and into the churning sea, wave upon wave resembling mountains.  \nDarkness, howling winds, nature's overwhelming power swallowed everything.  \nAlgernon pulled out a white handkerchief, wiped his right palm clean, then tossed it into the sea.  \nStepping back, he waited patiently for his companion to enter.  \n\"What happened?\" Within seconds, the man with soft yellow hair burst in.  \n\"The 'captain' escaped,\" Algernon panted, sounding懊恼. \"He still retains some extraordinary power!\"  \n\"Damn it!\" the yellow-haired man cursed under his breath.  \nHe moved to the breach, staring intently into the distance, but all he saw were wind and waves.  \n\"Forget it, he's just an afterthought,\" the yellow-haired man waved his arm dismissively. \"Finding this Tudor-era ghost ship, we'll only gain merit.\"  \nEven a being favored by the sea dared not dive into the water in such weather.  \n\"And if the storm continues, the 'captain' won't last much longer,\" Algernon nodded, noticing the wooden wall's breach healing visibly.  \nHe glanced deeply, unconsciously turning his head towards the helm and sails.  \nEven through layers of wood, he could perceive their state.  \nNo first mate, no second mate, no crew, no sailors, not even a living soul!  \nEmpty, the helm and sails adjusted themselves诡异地.  \nThe image of the \"Fool,\" shrouded in gray and white mist, resurfaced in his mind. Algernon sighed deeply.  \nHe turned to the raging storm outside, whispering in a tone of both anticipation and fear:  \n\"A new era has begun...\"  \n\n**Part 2**\n\nIn the Queens Quarter, the capital of Roon Kingdom, Audery Hall pinched her cheek, unable to believe what had just transpired.  \nBefore her, the ancient copper mirror on her dressing table lay shattered into pieces.  \nLowering her gaze, Audery saw \"Deep Red\" swirling on her handback, like a tattoo of stars.  \nThe \"Deep Red\" gradually faded, finally vanishing beneath her skin.  \nOnly then did Audery confirm she wasn't dreaming.  \nHer eyes shimmered, her lips curved upwards, and she stood up, bending to lift her skirt.  \nShe bowed to the air, then moved lightly, spinning her body to perform the \"Ancient Elf Dance,\" the latest宫廷流行舞.  \nHer figure flowed gracefully, a brilliant smile on her face.  \n*Knock knock knock!* The door to her room was suddenly knocked on.  \n\"Who is it?\" Audery stopped abruptly, assuming a refined posture.  \n\"Miss, may I enter? It's time to prepare,\" her maid asked from outside.  \nAudery glanced sideways at the mirror on the dressing table, quickly suppressing her smile, leaving only a faint line.  \nShe looked left and right, satisfied with her appearance before speaking softly:  \n\"Come in.\"  \nTwisting her wrist, her maid Anne pushed the door open.  \n\"Oh, it's broken...\" Anne immediately noticed the state of the ancient copper mirror.  \nAudery blinked, speaking slowly:  \n\"Well, yes, um, Susie came in earlier, you know, she always likes to destroy things!\"  \nSusie was a large golden retriever with less than pure lineage, a gift from Lord Hall when he purchased foxhounds, but dearly loved by Audery.  \n\"You need to discipline her properly,\" Anne said, expertly cleaning up the mirror shards, careful not to injure her mistress.  \nAfter finishing, she looked at Audery, smiling:  \n\"What dress would you like?\"  \nAudery thought for a moment: \"The one designed by Mrs. Ginny for my seventeenth birthday.\"  \n\"No, that would cause rumors about the Hall family's financial crisis, wearing the same dress twice in a formal occasion!\" Anne shook her head.  \n\"But I really like it,\" Audery emphasized gently.  \n\"You can wear it at home, or in less formal settings,\" Anne stated firmly.  \n\"Then the one Cedric sent yesterday, the one with the lace trim on the sleeves,\" Audery took a subtle breath, maintaining her elegant, sweet smile.  \n\"You always have such good taste,\" Anne smiled, stepping back and calling out, \"Cabinet number six, no, I'll get it myself.\"  \nThe maids sprang into action. One for the dress, one for jewelry, one for shoes, one for the veil, one to dress Audery, and one to consider the hairstyle.  \nAs preparations wound down, Lord Hall, wearing a brown tailcoat and matching brown top hat with neatly trimmed sideburns, appeared at the door.  \nHis sapphire eyes held a smile, but松弛的肌肉, a protruding belly, and deepening法令纹 marred the handsome face he once possessed.  \n\"The brightest gem in Beckland, it's time to go,\" Lord Hall stood at the entrance, lightly tapping the open door.  \n\"Dad, please don't call me that,\" Audery stood up with her maid's help, feigning a bit of exasperation.  \n\"Then my beautiful little princess, it's time to go,\" Lord Hall bent his left arm, indicating she should take his arm.  \nAudery smiled faintly and shook her head:  \n\"This is Lady Hall, your mother, my dear.\"  \n\"Then this way,\" Lord Hall smiled, bending his right arm. \"As a father's pride.\"  \n\n**Part 3**\n\nAt Prizt Port, Oak Island, Royal Naval Base, Audery was stunned by the sheer size before her as she descended from the carriage.  \nIn the nearby harbor lay a magnificent vessel, gleaming with metallic sheen, devoid of sails, equipped with two tall funnels and two open turrets, one fore and one aft.  \nIt was so imposing, so colossal, dwarfing the nearby sailing battleships like newborn pygmies簇拥着巨灵.  \n\"Storm above...\"  \n\"Oh, my Lord...\"  \n\"Ironclad!\"  \nThe murmurs rose and intertwined, Audery felt the same震撼, a human miracle, an unprecedented maritime marvel!  \nIt took an indeterminate time for the nobles, ministers, and members of the Lower House to regain their composure. Just then, a black dot appeared in the sky, growing larger until it filled a third of the heavens, capturing everyone's attention and casting a somber mood.  \nA colossal creature hovered in the sky, with incredibly smooth and elegant lines, painted deep blue. A sturdy yet lightweight alloy frame supported the fabric filled with gas囊, below which hung a compartment housing organic gun ports, bomb hatches, and flat-trajectory cannons. The cacophony of the high-calorific steam engine's exaggerated drone and the疯狂转动 of the propeller blades formed a stirring anthem.  \nThe飞空艇 carrying the King's family landed, exuding an傲慢俯视一切的威严.  \nOn the sides of the compartment, the \"Judgment Sword\" emblem, a vertical sword with a red ruby crown at the base, reflected the sunlight, a symbol tracing back to the last era of the Augusta family.  \nAudery was not yet eighteen, had not participated in the \"Introduction Ceremony,\" and was only allowed to observe quietly in the queen's引领下正式进入贝克兰德社交场合, marking her adulthood, unable to approach.  \nStill, she wasn't overly concerned, even feeling a sense of relief from not having to face the princes.  \nThe human \"miracle\" of conquering the skies landed steadily. First out were the spirited young guards, dressed in red uniforms, white trousers, with insignia, holding rifles, lining up in two rows, awaiting the appearance of King George III and the royal family.  \nAudery hadn't seen many bigwigs, showed no interest, instead her gaze wandered towards the two black-armored knights beside the king, resembling statues.  \nIn this age of steel, steam, and cannons, there were still people clad head-to-toe in full armor!  \nThe cold metallic gleam, the deep black helms, conveyed a sense of weight, solemnity, and unquestionable authority.  \n\"Could they be the higher-tier 'Disciplinarian Knights'...\" Audery thought of idle chatter among her elders, curious but dared not approach.  \nWith the royal family's arrival, the ceremony began. Lord Agughe Negan, the current Secretary of State for War and the Navy, stepped forward.  \nA conservative party member, he was one of only two individuals to become Secretary of State without noble birth, awarded the title of Baron for his outstanding contributions.  \nOf course, Audery knew more. His brother, the main pillar of the conservatives, was Palas Negan, the current Duke of Negan!  \nAgughe was in his fifties, tall and thin, with sparse hair and sharp eyes. Surveying the crowd, he declared:  \n\"Ladies and gentlemen, you have seen this is an ironclad, a颠覆时代的铁甲舰. Length 101 meters, beam 21 meters, height designed above the waterline, main armor belt 457mm thick, displacement 10,060 tons, four 305mm main guns fore and aft, plus six rapid-fire guns, twelve 6-pounders, eighteen six-barreled machine guns, and four torpedo tubes, with a speed of up to 16 knots!\"  \n\"It will be the true master of the seas! It will conquer the ocean!\"  \nNobles, ministers, and parliamentarians stirred. Even Agughe's description allowed them to envision the terror of this ironclad, let alone seeing it firsthand!  \nAgughe showed a slight smile, delivered a few more speeches, then bowed to King George III:  \n\"Your Majesty, please bestow a name upon it.\"  \n\"Starting from Prizt Port, let's call it HMS Prizt,\" King George III said cheerfully.  \n\"HMS Prizt!\"  \n\"HMS Prizt!\"  \nThe name spread from the Naval Secretary and Commander-in-Chief down to the ironclad itself, cheered by officers and soldiers alike:  \n\"HMS Prizt!\"  \nIn the festive atmosphere, cannon salute echoed. King George III gave the order for departure and trial firing.  \nWah!  \nThe whistle blew, thick smoke billowed from the funnels, the sound of machinery运转隐约 audible.  \nThe colossal beast set sail. When it fired its forward guns at an uninhabited island ahead, everyone was stunned.  \n*BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!*  \nThe earth seemed to tremble, dust soared into the air, a hurricane肆虐 outward,掀起了滔天巨浪.  \nSecretary Agughe Negan turned satisfied, addressing the nobles, ministers, and parliamentarians:  \n\"From now on, those seven pirates who call themselves generals, those four pirates who僭越称王, can only tremble in fear, awaiting their end!\"  \n\"Their era has ended. No matter if they possess extraordinary power, ghost ships or curses, the one who will command the seas is the ironclad!\"  \nAt this, his chief secretary asked deliberately:  \n\"Can't they build their own ironclads?\"  \nSome nobles and parliamentarians nodded subtly, wondering if it was possible.  \nAgughe immediately broke into a smile, shaking his head slowly:  \n\"No, absolutely not! Impossible! Building such an ironclad requires three large coal-steel联合体, twenty以上的钢铁厂, the expertise of sixty scientists and more senior engineers from the Royal Artillery Research Institute and the Prizt Ship Research Institute, two Royal Naval shipyards and their affiliated hundred-plus component factories, a Ministry of the Navy, a shipbuilding committee, a cabinet, a visionary and resolute king, and a nation capable of producing 12 million tons of steel annually!\"  \n\"The pirates will never achieve it.\"  \nHe paused, then raised his arms, exclaiming passionately:  \n\"Ladies and gentlemen, the era of giant ships and big guns has arrived!\""}
{"chapter_index": 9, "title": "第9章 笔记", "baseline_translation": "\n**Chapter 9: Notes**\n\nAfter resting for half an hour, Qinglin Zhou, who had identified himself as Clene, felt himself recover. During this time, he noticed four black spots appear on the back of his right hand, forming a small square. These spots faded from dark to light and vanished quickly, but Clene knew they remained hidden within his body, waiting to be awakened.\n\n\"Four points, a square. Could it correspond to the four corners and four main foods? From now on, I wouldn't need to prepare main courses separately; I could directly proceed with the steps and incantations?\" Clene had a faint idea.\n\nThis seemed plausible, but the presence of something strange and inexplicable on his person filled him with unease. The mere existence of esoteric arts working here on Earth, without any prior understanding, added to the mystery. Then there was his inexplicable journey during sleep, the enigmatic and hallucinatory Grey Mist World, and the unsettling whispers that haunted the \"ritual\" around him, driving him close to madness. Clene couldn't help but shiver, even in the sweltering heat of late June.\n\nHe had once heard a saying: \"The oldest and strongest emotion of humanity is fear, and the oldest and strongest of all is the fear of the unknown.\" Now, he deeply felt the fear born from the unknown.\n\nUnprecedented and uncontrollable, a strong impulse surged within him: the desire to delve into the mysterious realm, to learn more, to unravel the unknown. Yet, there was also the urge to bury his head in the sand and pretend nothing had happened.\n\nThe sunlight streaming through the window was at its peak, dusting the desk with a layer of \"gold dust.\" Clene gazed at it, feeling a touch of warmth and hope. He relaxed a little, but the wave of exhaustion washed over him instantly.\n\nThe lack of sleep from the previous night and the recent expenditure left his eyelids heavy as lead, drooping uncontrollably. He shook his head, reached out to support himself on the edge of the desk, and ignored the black rye bread placed at the corners of the room. He staggered to the bunk bed, and as soon as he lay down, his head resting on the pillow, he fell asleep.\n\nGurgle! Gurgle!\n\nHunger awoke Clene. He opened his eyes, feeling refreshed. \"My head still aches a bit,\" he rubbed his temples and turned to sit up. He felt an appetite so strong he could eat an entire ox.\n\nAs he smoothed out the wrinkles in his clothes and returned to the desk, he picked up the silver watch with its vine-like pattern. *Click!* The cover snapped open, and the second hand ticked steadily. \"Half past twelve, I slept for over three hours...\" Clene swallowed, pocketing the watch.\n\nIn the Northlands, time was divided the same way: 24 hours, 60 minutes per hour, 60 seconds per minute. Whether each second felt the same length as on Earth, Clene couldn't say.\n\nTo him, at this moment, words like \"esotericism,\" \"ritual,\" or \"Grey Mist World\" could not enter his mind. The most pressing matter was food—food!\n\nOnly after eating could he think, could he do anything!\n\nWithout hesitation, Clene retrieved the four black rye loaves, shook off a little dust, and planned to use one as his midday meal. Since his hometown had a tradition of sharing sacrificial offerings, and these four loaves showed no signs of change, with only five shillings left in his pocket, he felt it was necessary to practice frugality.\n\nOf course, this was also subtly influenced by fragments of the original host's memories and habits.\n\nGas was too expensive, even for lighting, so it pained him. He took the stove out, added some coal, and paced back and forth, waiting for the water to boil.\n\nDry eating those rye loaves would make you choke! \"Oh, does this mean I’d have to subsist on black bread for breakfast and lunch, and only eat meat in the evening? No, it wasn't Melissa’s concern for my upcoming interview that kept me from eating meat only once a week...\" Clene looked around, too idle and hungry to ponder serious matters.\n\nThinking of the lamb, his eyes seemed to glint greenly as he stared at the cabinet.\n\n\"No, no, I have to wait for Melissa to eat with me,\" Clene shook his head firmly, dismissing the idea of eating half now.\n\nAs a lone wolf drifting in a big city, though his diet mostly consisted of eating out, he had at least mastered basic cooking skills—perhaps not gourmet, but sufficient.\n\nTurning his body, Clene decided to leave it at that. Just then, he remembered that besides buying the meat, he had also bought tender peas and potatoes!\n\nPotatoes! Inspiration struck him instantly. He spun around, rushed to the cabinet, and took out two potatoes from the few he had. He went to the public restroom, washed their skins clean, and then placed them directly into the pot with the water.\n\nAfter a while, he took out the spice box from the cabinet, opened the lid, and sprinkled a little yellowish and coarse salt into the water.\n\nHe waited patiently for a few more minutes before lifting the pot and pouring the watery broth into several cups and a large bowl. Finally, he took the two potatoes out with a fork and placed them on the table.\n\n*Whew!* As he peeled a bit of the skin and blew on his hand, the aroma of boiled potatoes slowly filled the air, enticing his appetite.\n\nSaliva secreted uncontrollably. Clene didn’t bother peeling just one half and didn’t mind the potatoes still being hot. He picked one up and took a big bite.\n\nFluffy! Delicious! Sweet on the aftertaste! Clene’s heart swelled with emotion. He wolfed down the two potatoes, even eating some of the skin. Only then did he pick up the bowl and take a satisfying sip of the \"broth.\" The faint saltiness washed away the dryness in his mouth.\n\n\"Back when I was a child, I loved this the most...\" Padding his stomach, Clene silently reflected while breaking the rye bread and dipping it in the \"broth\" to soften it before eating.\n\nPerhaps the previous \"ritual\" had drained him significantly, as he ate two loaves—entirely a pound—before feeling fully alive again, re-experiencing the joy of being human and basking in the warmth of the sunlight.\n\nHe sat back at the desk, pondering what to do next.\n\n\"I can’t avoid it. I must find a way to contact the mysterious realm and become an 'Extraordinary' in the eyes of 'Justice' and 'The Hanged Man'.\"\n\n\"I have to overcome the fear caused by the unknown.\"\n\n\"The only path available now is to wait for the next 'gathering' and see if I can overhear the 'Audience' potion recipe or some other esoteric knowledge.\"\n\n\"There are four days left until Monday. Before then, I need to confront the issues of the original host. Why did he commit suicide? What happened to him?\"\n\nUnable to travel back in time and simply walk away, Clene picked up the notebook that was laid open. He flipped through it, hoping to find some clues to piece together the fragmented memories.\n\nClearly, the original host had a habit of taking notes and even using them as diaries. Clene knew that the cabinet beneath the right leg of the desk was filled with completed notebooks.\n\nThis particular one started from May 10th, with entries mostly concerning school, mentors, and knowledge:\n\n\"May 12th: Mr. Azir mentioned that the common language of the Southlands' Baelar Empire also originates from Ancient Fasque, a branch of Giant speech. Why is that? Did all sentient beings once speak the same language? No, this must be wrong. Even according to the 'Night of Revelation' and 'Book of Storms,' in an era older than antiquity, giants were not the sole rulers of the continents; there were also elves, aberrations, and dragons. Well, these are just legends, mythological stories.\"\n\n...\n\n\"May 16th: I discussed the inevitability of the Steam Age with Senior Professor Cohen and Mr. Azir. Mr. Azir believed it was coincidental. Without the sudden appearance of Emperor Rossel, perhaps the Northlands would still be in the age of cold weapons like the Southlands. My mentor thought he overstated the role of individuals. He believed that with the progression of time, even without Emperors Rossel and Robert, the Steam Age would eventually arrive, though perhaps delayed. To me, their debate seemed meaningless. I prefer to discover new things and uncover the history obscured by mist. Perhaps I shouldn’t study history; maybe archaeology is a better fit.\"\n\n...\n\n\"May 29th: Welch found me and said he had acquired a notebook from the Fourth Era. My goddess, a Fourth Era notebook! He didn’t want to bother his archaeology friends for help in deciphering its contents. How could I refuse? Of course, it had to be after the graduation defense, as I couldn’t afford to be distracted then.\"\n\nReading this, Clene felt a surge of excitement. Compared to the historical notes and debates from before, the newly discovered \"Fourth Era\" notebook was more likely to explain the original host's suicide.\n\nThe Fourth Era was the period before the current \"Black Iron Era.\" Its history was shrouded in mist, with many gaps. Even the tombs, ancient cities, and documents unearthed were scarce. Historians and archaeologists could only piece together a faint outline of the \"past\" by relying on the ambiguous theological texts of the Seven Bishops, which were primarily used for faith-based education, to mention the existence of the Solomon Empire, Tudor Dynasty, and the T'lan Imass Empire.\n\nClene, who aspired to unravel the mist and restore history, had little interest in the \"first three eras,\" which were more mythological and legendary, focusing instead on the Fourth Era, also known as the \"Age of Gods.\" His excitement was understandable.\n\n\"Oh, so looking back, the original host's focus on the interview and worries about future employment were unnecessary...\" Clene couldn't help but remark.\n\nUniversities were still rare, and the vast majority of students were from noble families or wealthy households. For commoners, entering one, even with discrimination and exclusion from social circles, still offered valuable人脉 resources through group discussions and collective activities—resources that were quite precious!\n\nFor example, Welch McGowan was the son of a banker from Kinstron in Intersea County, Ruun Kingdom. He was generous and well-off. Due to working on assignments and reports with Clene and Nya in the same group, he had become accustomed to asking them for help.\n\nWithout further diverging, Clene continued reading the notes:\n\n\"June 18th: Graduated. Farewell, Hoyle University!\"\n\n\"June 19th: I saw that notebook. After comparing its structure and word roots, I realized it was a variant of Ancient Fasque. More precisely, over a thousand years, Ancient Fasque had been subtly evolving.\"\n\n\"June 20th: We deciphered the first page. The author belonged to a family named 'Antigonous'.\"\n\n\"June 21st: He mentioned the 'Black Emperor.' This contradicted the era deduced from the previous content. Could my mentor be wrong? Was the 'Black Emperor' a title held by every emperor of the Solomon Empire?\"\n\n\"June 22nd: The family named 'Antigonous' held significant status in the Solomon Empire according to the notebook. The writer mentioned being involved in a secret transaction with someone named Tudor. Tudor? Tudor Dynasty?\"\n\n\"June 23rd: I forced myself not to think about that notebook anymore. I had to prepare for the interview! It was a very important matter!\"\n\n\"June 24th: Nya told me they had new findings. I think I should go check it out.\"\n\n\"June 25th: From the newly deciphered content, it seems the notebook's owner accepted a mission to travel to the summit of the 'Horachies' Mountains to visit the 'Land of Night' at its peak. My goddess, the main peak of the Horachies Mountains exceeds six thousand meters. How could a country exist there? How do they survive?\"\n\n\"June 26th: Are all these strange things real?\"\n\nThe notebook ended there. Zhou Mingrui had traveled through to the twenty-eighth of June.\n\n\"So, the notebook for the seventh must have existed. It was that sentence... 'Everyone will die, including me...'\"\n\nClene flipped to the first page he had seen, making a judgment tinged with a hint of unease.\n\nHe believed that to solve the mystery of the original host's suicide, he should visit Welch and examine the ancient notebook. However, with his experience from countless novels, movies, and TV shows, he felt that if he went, and if the matter was indeed connected, he would likely face unknown dangers—those foolish individuals who ventured into haunted castles were a stark warning!\n\nBut he couldn't avoid it either. Avoidance would never solve problems; it would only make them accumulate until they overflowed, completely淹没ing him.\n\nShould he call the police? That couldn't be, could it?\n\n*Knock! Knock-knock!*\n\nA sharp, forceful knock echoed at the door.\n\nClene sat up abruptly, straining to listen.\n\n*Knock! Knock-knock!*\n\nThe knocking reverberated through the empty, desolate hallway."}
{"chapter_index": 10, "title": "第10章 常态", "baseline_translation": "\n**Chapter 10: Normalcy**\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\nKlein was still pondering the mysterious suicide of his original host and the potential unknown dangers he might face when he heard the sudden knock at the door. Instinctively, he pulled out the drawer, took out the revolver, and questioned warily.\n\nThere was a moment of silence outside the door, then a slightly piercing voice called out in the A-Hoawa dialect:\n\n\"I am, Montebank, Beatrix Montebank.\"\n\nThe voice paused for a second before adding:\n\n\"Police.\"\n\nBeatrix Montebank... As the name entered his ears, Klein immediately recalled the owner of that name.\n\nHe was one of the police officers responsible for the apartment's neighborhood—a rough, thuggish man who loved to use his fists, but perhaps only someone like him could intimidate the drunks, thieves, part-time pickpockets, ruffians, and villains.\n\nThe unique voice was one of his trademarks.\n\n\"Alright, I'm coming!\" Klein responded loudly.\n\nHe had originally planned to toss the revolver back into the drawer, but considering that the police outside might have come for a reason and could take action, he carefully walked over to the fireplace where the embers had long since died out and placed the gun inside.\n\nThen, he took the small coal basket, sprinkled a few pieces of coal into the fireplace, covered the gun with them, and finally placed the teapot on top to conceal everything.\n\nAfter doing this, he straightened his clothes, quickly approached the door, opened it halfway, and mumbled:\n\n\"Sorry, I was just taking a nap.\"\n\nOutside stood four police officers in black uniforms with white squares, wearing badge caps. Beatrix Montebank, with his brown-yellow beard, cleared his throat and said to Klein:\n\n\"This officer has something to ask you.\"\n\nOfficer? Klein reflexively glanced at the shoulder badges of the other three, noticing two with three silver pentagrams and one with two, all seemingly higher-ranking than Beatrix Montebank, who had only three V-shaped badges. As a history student, Klein wasn't well-versed in police ranks, but he knew Beatrix Montebank often boasted about being a senior inspector.\n\nSo, were those three commissioners? Influenced by the conversations of his classmates, Banison and Welch, Klein still knew a bit of common sense. He stepped aside, gestured inside, and asked:\n\n\"Please come in. What's the matter?\"\n\nThe lead officer among the three was a middle-aged man with piercing eyes that seemed to see through the soul, evoking an involuntary fear. His eyes were lined with noticeable wrinkles, and a faint brown hairline peeked from the edge of his cap. He cast a critical glance around the room while speaking in a low, stern voice:\n\n\"Do you know Welch McGavin?\"\n\n\"He what?\" Klein's heart skipped a beat as he blurted out in surprise.\n\n\"I'm asking you,\" the stern middle-aged officer said, his eyes glaring.\n\nThe officer beside him, wearing a three-star badge, looked at Klein and smiled gently:\n\n\"Don't be nervous, we're just doing our routine inquiry.\"\n\nThe officer was in his thirties, with a straight nose bridge and gray eyes that held an indescribable depth, like an untouched lake in an ancient forest.\n\nKlein took a deep breath and organized his thoughts:\n\n\"If you're referring to Welch McGavin, the graduate from Hoyle University from Constantine, then yes, I know him well. We were classmates, studied under the same mentor, Senior Lecturer Quentin Cohen.\"\n\nIn the Kingdom of Luun, \"professor\" wasn't just a title but also a position, much like professors combined with department heads in the Earth's academic system. Essentially, one department in a university could only have one professor, and an associate professor could only become a full professor upon their superior's retirement or by ousting them through merit.\n\nTo retain talent, after years of exploration, the Kingdom's Higher Education Council added the position of Senior Lecturer to the lecturer, associate professor, and professor hierarchy, for those academics who were highly qualified or had enough seniority but couldn't become professors.\n\nKlein looked at the middle-aged officer's eyes, thought for a second, and then said:\n\n\"Honestly, our relationship wasn't bad. Lately, I've been meeting with him and Naya frequently, interpreting and discussing the 'Fourth Dynasty' manuscript he obtained—a notebook. Officer, what happened to him?\"\n\nThe middle-aged officer didn't answer but glanced sideways at his colleague with the gray eyes.\n\nThe officer with the gray eyes, wearing a badge cap and with average features, replied calmly:\n\n\"I'm sorry to inform you, Mr. Welch has passed away.\"\n\n\"How?\" Although there had been a faint suspicion, Klein couldn't help but exclaim in shock.\n\nWelch had died just like the original host?\n\nThat was terrifying!\n\n\"Where is Naya?\" Klein hurriedly asked.\n\n\"Miss Naya has also passed away,\" the gray-eyed officer said calmly. \"They were found dead in Mr. Welch's residence.\"\n\n\"Murdered?\" Klein guessed faintly.\n\nPerhaps it was suicide...\n\nThe gray-eyed officer shook his head:\n\n\"No, based on the traces at the scene, it appears to be suicide. Mr. Welch repeatedly slammed his head against the wall until it was covered in blood. Miss Naya drowned herself in a basin, the kind used for washing.\"\n\n\"It's impossible...\" Klein shuddered, as if able to visualize the eerie scene.\n\nThe girl kneeling before the chair, her face submerged in the basin filled with water, her brown hair flowing gently, yet the body completely still; Welch lying on the ground, his eyes fixed on the ceiling, his forehead shattered and covered in blood, and the wall stained with impact marks, dripping with fresh blood...\n\nThe gray-eyed officer's lips twitched slightly as he said:\n\n\"We initially thought the same, but the autopsy results and the scene ruled out factors like drugs or external force. They... I mean, Mr. Welch and Miss Naya showed no signs of resistance.\"\n\nBefore Klein could speak again, the officer entered the room and feigned casualness as he asked:\n\n\"When was the last time you saw Mr. Welch or Miss Naya?\"\n\nHe said this while eyeing the officer with two stars.\n\nThat officer was young, looked roughly the same age as Klein, with black hair and green eyes, an attractive appearance, and a poetic romantic aura.\n\nUpon hearing the question, Klein quickly thought it over and decided on his answer:\n\n\"It should have been June 26th. We interpreted a new section of the notebook together, and then I went home to prepare for the 30th's interview, yes, the interview for the history department at Tingorn University.\"\n\nTingorn City, known as the City of Universities, housed Tingorn and Hoyle universities, along with technical schools, the Bar Institute, and business schools, making it second only to the capital, Beckland.\n\nJust as he finished speaking, Klein noticed the young officer walk over to the desk and pick up the \"notebook,\" which looked more like a diary.\n\nTrouble! He'd forgotten to hide it! Klein shouted urgently: \"You!\"\n\nThe young officer smiled at him but didn't stop flipping through the notebook. The gray-eyed officer explained:\n\n\"This is standard procedure.\"\n\nAt this point, Beatrix Montebank and the stern middle-aged officer merely stood by, neither intervening nor assisting in the search.\n\nWhere's your search warrant? Klein was about to ask, but upon careful reflection, he realized the Luun Kingdom's justice system hadn't evolved to include search warrants yet, at least not that he knew of. Even the police force was only established fifteen or sixteen years ago. When the original host was a child, they were still called constables.\n\nKlein couldn't stop the search. He watched helplessly as the young officer quickly flipped through \"his notebook,\" and the gray-eyed officer didn't ask any more questions.\n\n\"What strange things were in it?\" the young officer suddenly asked after flipping to the end. \"And what does this mean? 'Everyone will die, including me...'\"\n\nIsn't it common knowledge that everyone, except the divine, will die? Klein had originally prepared a lie, but suddenly remembered that he had intended to \"connect\" with the police to prepare for potential dangers, but lacked a reason or excuse.\n\nIn less than a second, he made his decision, covering his forehead with his hand and answering in pain:\n\n\"I don't know, I really don't know... Since waking up this morning, I've felt something was off, like I've forgotten some things, especially parts of recent days, and I don't even know why I wrote such a line.\"\n\nSometimes, confessing is the best way to solve problems, of course, with the right technique. What to say and what not to say was one aspect; the order and manner of speaking was another.\n\nAs a \"keyboard\" expert, Klein had studied a bit of rhetoric.\n\n\"Preposterous! Are we supposed to think you're crazy?\" Beatrix Montebank angrily interjected, unable to hold back any longer.\n\nThis lie was too拙劣 (tawdry), it was insulting their intelligence!\n\nBetter to pretend to be mentally ill than pretend to have amnesia!\n\n\"Really,\" Klein responded calmly to Montebank and the middle-aged officer's gazes.\n\nThis lie was truly believable.\n\n\"Perhaps it's possible,\" the gray-eyed officer said slowly.\n\nWhat? Believing him so easily? Klein was even more surprised.\n\nThe gray-eyed officer smiled at him:\n\n\"We'll have an expert come by in a couple of days. Believe me, she should be able to help you recover your lost memories.\"\n\nAn expert? Help recall? In the psychology field? Klein frowned.\n\nOh no, what if she brings back my memories from Earth? He suddenly felt a toothache.\n\nThe young officer put down the notebook and searched the desk and room thoroughly. Fortunately, he focused on the books and didn't examine the teapot.\n\n\"Alright, Mr. Klein, thank you for your cooperation. For the next few days, you'd better not leave Tingorn. If you must, notify Officer Montebank. Otherwise, you'll be considered a fugitive,\" the gray-eyed officer finally instructed.\n\nIs that it? The day was over? No more questions? No further investigation? Or would he be taken back to the police station for interrogation? Klein felt bewildered.\n\nHowever, he also wanted to resolve the eerie incident involving Welch, so he nodded:\n\n\"No problem.\"\n\nThe officers filed out of the room in order. The young man at the end suddenly patted Klein on the shoulder:\n\n\"Good for you, you're lucky.\"\n\n\"What?\" Klein looked utterly confused.\n\nThe officer with the poet's气质 (aura) and green eyes smiled slightly:\n\n\"In general, when something like this happens, it's normal for the involved parties to all die.\"\n\n\"We're glad, and lucky, that you're still alive.\"\n\nWith that, he walked out of the room, politely closing the door behind him.\n\nAll involved die as normalcy? Glad that I'm still alive? Lucky that I'm still alive?\n\nAs June afternoon wore on, a chill ran down Klein's spine."}
