**Chapter Title:** The 4th Chapter Divination

**English Draft:**

Re-seating himself, Zhou Mingrui waited until the distant church bell tolled seven times, the echoes fading slowly, before he rose leisurely and moved towards the cabinet, retrieving his attire.

A black tailcoat, trousers cinching slightly at the ankles, and a low-crowned top hat completed the ensemble, lending him the semblance of Victorian drama. Gazing into the mirror, he saw not merely a reflection, but a stagehand preparing for a scene.

"A mere errand, nothing more... just procuring materials for a... divination ritual," he muttered softly, shaking his head with a wry smile. "Clayen was so preoccupied with the impending interview that even his body adopted this habit, this sole respectable attire, whenever his focus wavered."

Exhaling, he removed the tailcoat and waistcoat, replacing them with an aged, tawny-colored overcoat and a matching felt top hat with a round brim. Adjusting himself, he approached the bunk bed, lifted the mattress, and reached through a discreet tear in the base, fingers probing until he found the hidden compartment.

His right hand withdrew clutching a roll of banknotes, roughly seven bills, their color a deep, almost translucent emerald green.

This was Benson's entire savings, the funds covering his sustenance for these three days. Only two five-Soli notes remained; the rest were one-Soli bills.

Within the monetary hierarchy of the Loen Kingdom, the Soli ranked second, originating from ancient silver coins, with twelve Pennies to a Soli. Denominations included the One-Soli and the Five-Soli notes.

At the apex sat the Gold Pound, a paper currency backed by gold, directly convertible. One Gold Pound equated to twenty Soli, available in One, Five, and Ten denominations.

Unfurling the notes, a faint, peculiar scent of ink permeated the air—a scent tinged with the very essence of currency.

Perhaps it was the lingering influence of Clayen’s fragmented memories, or perhaps it was the unchanging, deep-seated desire for wealth within himself, but in that moment, Zhou Mingrui found himself inexplicably enamored with these little notes.

Look, the designs were exquisite, rendering the dour King George III, with his waxed handlebar mustache, almost endearing... Look, the watermark visible through the sunlight was tantalizing, the meticulously crafted anti-counterfeiting tags distinguishing it from its fraudulent counterparts with an undeniable grace!

He admired the notes for nearly half a minute, then extracted two One-Soli bills, rolling the remainder back up and returning them to the hidden pocket within the mattress.

Tidying the torn fabric around the hole, he neatly folded the two One-Soli notes and slipped them into the left breast pocket of his tawny overcoat, separating them from the Pennies tucked into his trouser pockets.

Pocketed the keys in his right pocket and slinging the deep brown paper bag over his shoulder, he strode towards the door.

Thump-thump, his footsteps quickened then slowed, finally ceasing.

Zhou Mingrui stood by the door, his brow furrowed unknowingly.

The unresolved mysteries surrounding Clayen’s suicide—would venturing out now invite some unforeseen "misfortune"?

After a moment’s contemplation, he returned to the desk, pulled open a drawer, and retrieved the brass revolver, its gleaming surface a stark contrast to the shadows.

This was the only weapon he could think of, yet a potent one! Though he had never fired a shot in anger, merely drawing this pistol should suffice to intimidate.

Running his fingers over the cold metal cylinder, he stuffed the revolver into the pocket containing the banknotes, clenching the notes in his palm and pressing the grip firmly against his leg, concealing the gesture.

A sense of security bloomed within him, yet a nagging doubt surfaced:

"Won't it discharge accidentally?"

Ruminating, he quickly devised a solution. Drawing the pistol, he flicked the cylinder to the left, ensuring the chamber left vacant by Clayen’s "suicide" was now aligned for safety, then snapped it shut with a decisive click.

Thus, any misfire would be inert, utterly harmless.

Re-pocketing the revolver, his left hand remained embedded in the coat, no longer free.

He adjusted his cap with his right hand and pushed open the door, stepping out with a resolute stride.

The corridor remained dimly lit even at midday, sunlight filtering through the end windows meagerly. Descending the stairs and stepping out of the apartment, he finally embraced the warmth and brightness.

Though July approached, heralding summer, the climate in Tingren, a northern city of the Loen Kingdom, possessed unique characteristics. Even the highest recorded temperatures on this world rarely exceeded thirty degrees Celsius, a mere ninety degrees Fahrenheit. The morning air was cool, yet the streets bore signs of neglect—puddles mingled with litter, a common sight in Clayen’s memory, even in areas with sewers, owing to the sheer density and poverty of the inhabitants.

"Try our delicious pan-fried meat and fish!" a流动摊贩 cried out.

"Fresh oysters, steaming hot, for just five Pennies a bowl in the morning!"

"Crispy little buns, Mackerel soup with Cider Beer!"

"Seashells, seashells, fresh from the tide!"

"Fresh vegetables from the countryside farms, cheap and delicious!"

...

Vegetable sellers, fruit vendors, and food stalls hawked their wares, their voices a cacophony amidst the hurried pedestrians. Some paused, deliberating their choices; others grew impatient, waving them off, work yet to be secured today.

Zhou Mingrui navigated the chaotic street, his left hand gripping the revolver tightly, clutching the banknotes in his palm, his right hand steadying the felt hat, head slightly bowed, eyes scanning the ground as he weaved through the crowd.

Crowded places bred thieves, especially in this district teeming with semi-employed laborers and hungry, exploited children.

As the crowd thinned, he straightened his posture, raised his head, and surveyed the street ahead.

A street musician played his hurdy-gurdy nearby, the melody both melancholic and spirited.

Beside him, ragged children, their faces蜡黄 from malnutrition, swayed to the rhythm, their bodies instinctively twisting in a self-invented dance, their faces alight with joy, as if they were little princes or angels.

A woman with a dour visage passed by, her skirt soiled, skin dull. Her eyes were vacant, yet a flicker of recognition sparked when she glanced at the children, perhaps seeing a shadow of her own thirty years prior.

Zhou Mingrui passed her, turning down another street, stopping before "Slin's Bakery."

The owner, Mrs. Wendyslin, a septuagenarian with entirely gray hair, always wore a gentle smile. Since Clayen’s earliest memories, she had been selling bread and pastries here.

Hmm, her Tingren biscuits and lemon cakes were simply divine... Zhou Mingrui swallowed, smiling.

"Mrs. Slin, please, sixteen Black Rye loaves."

"Oh, little Clayen, where’s Benson? Not back yet?" Mrs. Slin asked, her eyes crinkling with amusement.

"Still a few days," Zhou Mingrui answered vaguely.

Mrs. Slin, meanwhile, was portioning out the bread, her tone tinged with nostalgia.

"He’s such a diligent lad, he’ll find a good wife yet." A playful curve touched her lips.

"Now it’s you, you’ve graduated. Our esteemed History graduate from Khoy University~ You’ll soon be earning your keep. You shouldn’t live in such a run-down apartment; at the very least, you need your own washroom."

"Mrs. Slin, you look remarkably young and vibrant today," Zhou Mingrui managed a nervous chuckle.

If Clayen secured the position as a Lecturer at Tingren University, their family’s fortunes would indeed improve! In his fragmented memories, he had even fantasized about renting a standalone house in the suburbs, complete with five or six rooms upstairs, two washrooms, a large balcony, two rooms downstairs, a dining room, a living room, a kitchen, another washroom, and a basement storage.

Not an impossible dream; even an intern Lecturer at Tingren University earned a weekly salary of two Gold Pounds, rising to three Gold Pounds and ten Soli upon confirmation. Knowing that his brother, Benson, with years of service, earned a mere one Pound and ten Soli weekly, while factory laborers often scraped by on less than one Pound, Zhou Mingrui calculated the cost of such a house, ranging from nineteen Soli to one Pound and eighteen Soli per month in rent.

"It’s the difference between earning three thousand Soli monthly and fourteen thousand five hundred..." he mused under his breath.

Yet, all this hinged on passing the interview at either Tingren or Backlund University.

Other avenues? Without connections, one couldn't secure a Pathway into public service, and historians faced even narrower job prospects, with private advisors for nobles or industrial magnates being a rare commodity.

Considering that Clayen’s knowledge was fragmented, incomplete, riddled with gaps, Zhou Mingrui felt a wave of awkwardness and unease regarding Mrs. Slin’s hopeful words.

"No, I’ve always been young at heart," Mrs. Slin quipped, handing him the measured sixteen Black Rye loaves in his own brown paper bag.

"Nine Pennies," she held out her right hand.

Each loaf weighed approximately half a Pound, with inevitable variance.

"Nine Pennies? That’s less than the two days ago, wasn't it eleven?" Zhou Mingrui asked reflexively.

And just last month, it was fifteen Pennies.

"The repeal of the 'Grain Act' and the demonstrations thanking those who protested," Mrs. Slin gestured expansively with both hands, a knowing smile playing on her lips.

Zhou Mingrui nodded vaguely, his memories of the 'Grain Act' fragmented, recalling only that its core was protecting domestic agricultural prices, preventing the import of grain from southern nations like Fenwport, Masque, and Luxembourg until prices reached a certain threshold.

Why would people protest such a measure?

He didn't dwell on it, mindful of the revolver in his pocket. Carefully extracting banknotes, he produced a One-Soli bill and offered it to Mrs. Slin.

Receiving three Pennies in change, he slipped them into his trouser pocket before heading towards the "Lettuce and Meat Market" down the street, endeavoring to fulfill his sister Melissa’s request for lamb stew with tender peas.

At the junction of Iron Cross Street and the Crocuses Street lay the Town Square, now bustling with activity as numerous tents had been erected. A bizarrely dressed clown, distributing pamphlets, caught his eye.

"Tomorrow evening, Circus performance?" Zhou Mingrui glanced at the pamphlet, whispering its contents.

Melissa would adore it. What was the cost of admission? The thought crossed his mind as he approached.

He was about to inquire of the clown in his red-and-yellow attire when a raspy female voice spoke from his side:

"Desire divination?"

Twisting his head instinctively, Zhou Mingrui saw a woman standing before a low tent, her head covered by a pointed hat, dressed in a black gown, her face daubed with red and yellow theatrical makeup, her eyes a deep, grayish-blue.

"No," he shook his head, lacking the means for such frivolity.

The woman smiled enigmatically.

"My Tarot divination is remarkably accurate."

"Tarot..." Zhou Mingrui froze.

The pronunciation bore a striking resemblance to the Tarot cards from his own world!

And in his world, Tarot was a form of fortune-telling using playing cards, augmented with symbolic 'picture cards'.

Wait... a sudden recollection struck him. The origin of Tarot divination in this world was not from the Seven orthodox deities, nor ancient relics, but was invented over one hundred seventy years prior by Rosier Gustav, then the Head of State of the Intish Republic.

This Rosier gentleman had invented the steam engine, improved sailing ships, overthrown the Intish Kingdom's monarchy, and gained the recognition of the 'God of Artisans' church, becoming the first Head of State of the new republic.

He went on to conquer territories, incorporating nations like Luxembourg into the Intish sphere, compelling powers like the Loen Kingdom, Fenwport, and Fasack Empire to submit. He later reorganized the republic into an empire, styling himself 'Caesar'.

It was during Rosier's reign that the church received its first public Revelation since the Fifth Century, leading to the title 'God of Steam and Machinery'. Rosier also invented Tarot divination, establishing the current composition and gameplay of the cards, including familiar games like Whist, Patience, Texas Hold'em, and Quart...

Furthermore, he dispatched fleets to discover routes to the southern continent through storms and chaotic currents, initiating the era of colonization.

Alas, his later years were marred by betrayal, culminating in his assassination by the Eternal Sun Church, the Solon family (the ruling dynasty of Intish), and other nobles in the year 1198 of the Fifth Century, dying in the White Maple Palace.

This recollection brought a peculiar ache to Zhou Mingrui’s teeth.

Could this woman be a fellow traveler from another world?

With this thought, he resolved to examine the Tarot cards here. He nodded towards the woman, the one with the painted face.

"If the price is reasonable, I shall give it a try," he said, his voice hesitant.

The woman beamed, "Sir, you are the first visitor today. It shall be free."
