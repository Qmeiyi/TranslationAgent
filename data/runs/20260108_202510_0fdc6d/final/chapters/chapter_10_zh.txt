**Chapter 10: The Norm**

**"Who?"**

Carrick, the new tenant, found himself lost in thought, pondering the mysterious circumstances surrounding his predecessor's suicide and the potential dangers he might face in this strange new world. The sudden knock at the door jolted him from his reverie. Instinctively, he pulled out his desk drawer, retrieved the revolver hidden inside, and queried the visitor with wary caution.

Silence held outside for two seconds, then a slightly reedy voice, speaking in the Arawa dialect, called out:
**"I am, Montebarton, Beiche Montebarton."**

Pausing briefly, it added:
**"Police."**

Beiche Montebarton… The name lodging in his ears instantly recalled its owner—a rough, brutal man prone to violence, one of the constables patrolling the district. Yet, perhaps only such a fellow could intimidate the drunks, thieves, opportunistic pickpockets, ruffians, and villains who infested the streets. His distinctive, slightly harsh voice was one of his trademarks.

**"Right then, I'll be along directly!"** Carrick responded loudly, trying to mask his unease.

His original intention was to toss the revolver back into the drawer, but the reason for the unexpected police visit remained unknown, and a search couldn't be ruled out. He cautiously moved to the fireplace where the embers had long since died out, depositing the pistol inside.

Next, he took the small coal basket, sprinkled a few pieces of coal into the fireplace, covering the gun, then placed the teapot on top to conceal everything completely.

Having done this, he straightened his attire and briskly approached the door, opening it while mumbling indistinctly:
**"Apologies, I was merely taking a short nap."**

Four police officers stood outside, dressed in black uniforms with white squares, wearing badge caps. Beiche Montebarton, with his brown-yellow beard, cleared his throat and informed Carrick:
**"These three officers have some questions for you."**

Officer? Carrick reflexively glanced at the shoulder insignia of the other three. Two bore three silver pentagrams, while one bore two. Clearly, they outranked Beiche Montebarton, whose insignia consisted of only three chevrons. As a history student, Carrick knew little about police ranks, only that Beiche Montebarton often boasted about being a senior inspector.
So, were those three commissioners? Influenced by the remarks of his friends Benson and Welch, Carrick possessed some general knowledge. He stepped aside, gesturing towards the interior of the room:
**"Please, come in. What is it regarding?"**

The foremost of the three officers was a middle-aged man whose piercing gaze seemed capable of seeing through the soul, inspiring an unavoidable dread. Deep wrinkles marked his eyes, and a faint auburn hairline peeked from beneath the edge of his cap. He cast a proprietary eye over the room while voicing his question gravely:
**"Do you know Welch McGavin?"**

**"What of him?"** Carrick's heart gave a jolt, and the words escaped his lips involuntarily. The name resonated with the recent, unsettling events.

**"I am the one asking you,"** the stern middle-aged officer replied, his expression grim.

His companion, who also wore three stars on his shoulder, looked at Carrick and smiled mildly:
**"No need for anxiety, we are merely conducting routine inquiries."**

This officer was in his thirties, with a straight nose bridge, and his grey eyes possessed an indescribable depth, reminiscent of an unfrequented lake in an ancient forest. There was an unnerving stillness about him.

Carrick drew in a breath, steeling himself, before replying:
**"If you refer to Welch McGavin, a graduate of Khoy University from Constancia, then yes, I know him well. We were fellow students, disciples of the esteemed Senior Lecturer Quentin Cohen."**

In the Loen Kingdom, "Professor" was not merely a title but a position, akin to the fusion of a professor and department head on Earth. Essentially, one university department could have only one Professor; an Associate Professor could only aspire to the "full" rank upon their superior's retirement or by displacing them through merit.

To retain talent, after years of exploration, the Loen Kingdom Higher Education Council had incorporated the position of Senior Associate Professor into the lecturer, associate professor, professor hierarchy, granting it to academically distinguished or sufficiently experienced individuals who hadn't reached the rank of Professor.

Pausing to study the middle-aged officer's eyes, Carrick considered for a second before speaking:
**"Frankly, our relationship was quite good. Lately, Carrick, Welch, and Naya have been meeting frequently to interpret and discuss the 'Fourth Dynasty' manuscript he obtained – a notebook, Officer. What has happened to him?"**

The middle-aged officer did not answer immediately, but glanced sideways at his grey-eyed companion.

The grey-eyed officer, plain-faced but polite, responded gently:
**"I'm very sorry, Mr. McGavin has passed away."**

**"Passed away?"** Though there had been a faint, dreadful premonition, Carrick couldn't help but exclaim in astonishment, his hand instinctively tightening on the doorframe. Welch also met the same fate as his predecessor? This was truly terrifying!

**"What about Naya?"** Carrick hurriedly pressed, his voice tight with fear.

**"Miss Naya has also passed,"** the grey-eyed officer stated calmly. **"They were found dead within Mr. McGavin's residence."**

**"Murdered?"** Carrick guessed faintly, his mind racing. Perhaps suicide… the thought offered a terrifying sliver of comfort.

The grey-eyed officer shook his head slowly:
**"No, based on the traces at the scene, it appears they took their own lives. Mr. McGavin repeatedly rammed his head against the wall, staining it blood-red. Miss Naya drowned herself in a basin, the kind used for washing."**

**"Impossible…"** Carrick shuddered, picturing the bizarre, horrifying scene vividly in his mind. The girl kneeling before the chair, her face submerged in the water-filled basin, her brown hair flowing gently; Welch sprawled on the floor, his eyes fixed on the ceiling, his forehead obliterated, stained with gore, and the wall, a canvas of impact marks, dripping blood… A chill ran down his spine, and his hands trembled uncontrollably. *He was a history student, not a supernatural investigator, yet the scene felt like something from a forbidden tome.*

The grey-eyed officer's lips moved slightly:
**"We initially thought the same, but the autopsy results and the scene itself ruled out factors like drugs or external force. They, I mean Mr. McGavin and Miss Naya, showed no signs of resistance."**

Before Carrick could speak again, the officer entered the room, feigning casual curiosity as he asked:
**"When was the last time you saw either Mr. McGavin or Miss Naya?"**

He spoke while directing a glance towards his colleague with the two silver stars.
That was a young officer, seemingly of an age comparable to Carrick himself, with black hair, green eyes, and a pleasant countenance, possessing a certain romantic poetical aura.

At the question, Carrick's mind raced, searching for an answer. He needed to buy time, deflect suspicion, and perhaps subtly steer the investigation towards the supernatural, as that was his only defense against the unknown dangers hinted at by the original tenant's suicide and now this scene.
**"Probably June 26th,"** he replied carefully. **"We interpreted a new section of the manuscript together, after which I returned home to prepare for my interview on the 30th, the interview for the History Department at Khoy University."**

Khoy University… Tingen City, known as the City of Universities, housed Khoy and Tingen Universities, alongside technical schools, the Bar Institute, and business colleges, ranking second only to the capital Backlund.

As soon as he finished speaking, his peripheral vision caught the young officer walking over to his desk and picking up the "notebook," which resembled a diary more than anything else. *Damn!* He'd forgotten to hide it!

Carrick muttered sharply: **"You!"**

The young officer offered him a polite smile, but continued turning pages in the notebook. The grey-eyed officer explained:
**"This is standard procedure."**

At this point, Beiche Montebarton and the stern middle-aged officer merely stood by, observing without intervening or assisting in the search. Where was their warrant? Carrick frowned, realizing that the concept of a warrant as understood in the modern world might not exist here, especially with the police force being only fifteen or sixteen years old itself. In his predecessor's childhood, they were still called Inspectors. *This world's legal system was different, perhaps less formal, but no less dangerous.*

Unable to stop them, Carrick watched helplessly as the young officer quickly scanned through the "his" notebook, the grey-eyed officer posing no further questions.

**"What peculiar items were found?"** the young officer suddenly queried after flipping to the end. **"And what does this mean? 'All will die, including me'…"**

Is it not common knowledge that everyone, except the divine, will die? Carrick had initially prepared a partial lie, but then abruptly remembered his original intention to "connect" with the police, as a precaution against potential dangers, and the strange events surrounding his arrival. This was his chance. He needed to play the part of the disturbed, grieving victim.
In less than a second, he made his decision, covering his forehead with his hand and replying with apparent agony:
**"I don't know, I truly don't know… Upon waking this morning, I felt something was amiss, as if I had forgotten certain things, particularly events of the past few days, and even couldn't recall why I wrote such a statement."**

Sometimes, confession was indeed the best course of action, provided it was handled with skill. What to confess, what to omit, and the sequence of revelations were crucial considerations. As someone who had navigated dangerous situations, Carrick understood the importance of plausible deniability.

**"Preposterous! Do we look like fools to you?"** Beiche Montebarton interjected angrily, unable to contain himself any longer. His harsh voice grated on the thin air. This lie was too tawdry, it bordered on insulting their intelligence!

Better to pretend insanity than feign amnesia!
**"Yes,"** Carrick replied calmly, holding the gaze of Montebarton and the middle-aged officer. He met their stares evenly. This fabrication was undeniably convincing, a carefully constructed shield.

**"Perhaps it is possible,"** the grey-eyed officer remarked slowly, his grey eyes seeming to weigh the words carefully.

What? Already believing him? Carrick was taken aback by the speed of the acceptance.

The grey-eyed officer smiled faintly at him:
**"A specialist will be coming in a couple of days. Believe me, she should be able to help you recover your lost memories."**

A specialist? Help recover memories? Carrick frowned. *Psychological help? What if this specialist dredged up memories of my home planet?* The thought caused a sharp, unfamiliar pain, like a splinter in his mind. An unwelcome side effect of his carefully constructed lie.

The young officer put down the notebook, conducted a thorough search of the desk and room, fortunately focusing on the books and not inquiring about the teapot.
**"Well then, Mr. Carrick, thank you for your cooperation. For the next few days, you'd best remain in Tingen. If travel is absolutely necessary, notify Constable Montebarton. Otherwise, you will be considered a fugitive."** The grey-eyed officer concluded.

That was it? The questioning concluded for the day? No further questions, no additional investigation? Or would he be taken back for interrogation and perhaps worse? Carrick felt a knot of confusion and unease tighten in his stomach.

However, he also wished to resolve the unsettling incident involving Welch, so he nodded, forcing calmness into his voice:
**"Understood."**

The officers filed out of the room. The one at the rear suddenly clapped Carrick on the shoulder, a surprisingly firm gesture.
**"Well done, you're quite lucky."**

**"What?"** Carrick looked utterly bewildered.

The green-eyed officer with the poetical flair smiled enigmatically:
**"Generally speaking, the norm is for all involved in such an event to perish."**

**"We are glad, and quite fortunate, that you are still alive."**

With that, he exited the room, politely closing the door behind him.

The norm is for all involved to perish? Glad we found you alive? Quite fortunate you are still here?
In that June afternoon, a profound chill ran down Carrick's spine, deeper than the physical cold, settling in his bones. He was alone again, the unsettling events of the day replaying in his mind, the weight of the revolver still felt heavy in his pocket, a silent reminder of the dangerous world he now inhabited.
