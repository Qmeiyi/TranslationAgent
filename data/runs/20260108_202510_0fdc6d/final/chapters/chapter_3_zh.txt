**Chapter 3: Melissa**

With the plan firmly established, Zhou Mingrui felt a newfound sense of purpose, the fear, hesitation, and unease receding into the corners of his mind. Only at this moment did he find the leisure to meticulously examine the fragmented memories left by Clarence.

Habitually, he rose, closed the pipeline valve, watched the wall lamp fade slowly until it extinguished, and then sank back into his seat. Absently stroking the brass cylinder of the revolver, he pressed his temple and quietly "relished" the crimson-lit darkness, much like the most attentive audience in a cinema.

Possibly influenced by the bullet wound, Clarence's memories were akin to shattered glass, not only lacking coherence but also missing significant portions. For instance, the origins of the finely crafted revolvers, whether the act was suicide or murder, and the meaning behind the notebook's inscription, "All will die, including me," remained elusive. Doubts also lingered about his involvement in peculiar events two days prior.

Not only were specific recollections fragmented, but even acquired knowledge seemed incomplete. In his current state, Zhou Mingrui believed Clarence would likely flunk out of university if he were to return, despite having only been away from campus for a few days and maintaining no leniency towards himself.

_"Two days hence, I must attend the history department interview at Ting Technical School..."_

_"The Loen Kingdom has a tradition of not retaining graduates directly in academia... Father provided letters of recommendation, one for Ting Technical School and one for Backlund University..."_

...

Lost in this silent contemplation, the red moon outside the window began to dip towards the western horizon, gradually sinking lower until the first faint light of dawn appeared on the eastern horizon, painting the horizon in hues of gold. Just then, a stir came from the inner room, quickly followed by footsteps approaching the partition door.

_"Melissa is awake... She's as punctual as ever." Zhou Mingrui offered a faint smile, influenced by Clarence's memories, seeing Melissa much like his own younger sister._

_"But I have no actual younger sister..."_ he mentally retorted.

Melissa was unlike Clarence or Benson; her foundational education was not completed at the Sunday School of the Evernight Goddess Church. By the time she reached school age, the Kingdom of Loen had enacted the Elementary Education Act, establishing a low-to-middle educational committee with dedicated funding to increase accessibility. Within three years, following the integration of numerous church-affiliated schools, a multitude of public elementary schools emerged, strictly adhering to the principle of religious neutrality, avoiding entanglements with the disputes of the Lord of Storms, the Evernight Goddess, and the God of Steam and Machinery churches.

Compared to the Sunday Schools, which cost a mere penny per week, the weekly three-penny tuition for public elementary schools seemed exorbitant. However, the former only operated once a week, while the latter required six full days of schooling, making the latter's cost more justifiable despite its higher price.

Melissa, unlike most girls, harboured a fascination for gears, springs, and bearings, aspiring to become a master of steam mechanics. Compensating for her earlier educational shortcomings and acutely aware of the importance of learning, her elder brother Benson, who had supported Clarence's university education, now nurtured his sister's dreams. After all, the Ting Technical School represented only secondary education, negating the need for further accumulation through grammar schools or public schools.

Last July, at fifteen years old, Melissa passed the entrance examination and, as desired, became a student in the Steam and Mechanics department at the Ting Technical School, with her weekly tuition increasing to nine pennies. Simultaneously, due to the impact of the Southland situation, the company Benson worked for suffered a significant decline in both profits and business volume, necessitating a workforce reduction exceeding one-third. To secure his job and sustain his livelihood, Benson could only accept heavier tasks, often requiring overtime or assignments to harsh environments, much like these recent days.

Clarence had contemplated alleviating his brother's burden but felt acutely aware of his own deficiencies as a commoner with only a basic grammar school education. For instance, Old Fasak, the foundational language of all North大陸 nations, was a subject taught from childhood to noble heirs and wealthy children, whereas he encountered it for the first time only during university. Similar shortcomings were numerous, and Clarence, pushing himself relentlessly, often staying up late and rising early, barely managed to keep pace, graduating with mediocre grades.

The memories of his brother and sister flickered in Zhou Mingrui's mind, until the door to the inner room creaked open, snapping him back to reality. He remembered the revolver still resting in his grasp—a semi-controlled item! It could frighten a child! And what about his own head wound!

As Melissa stepped through the doorway, Zhou Mingrui hastily pressed his temple, frantically pulling out the desk drawer and tossing the revolver inside with a resounding *thud*.

_"What’s wrong?" Melissa asked, her gaze filled with curiosity._

Though lean and pale due to inadequate nutrition, her youthful face still retained a luster that radiated the essence of a maiden. Meeting her hazel eyes fixed upon him, Zhou Mingrui forced composure, picking up nearby objects, then smoothly closing the drawer to conceal the revolver. The sensation of his hand on his temple confirmed the wound had healed.

From the drawer, he retrieved a silver-white pocket watch adorned with vine and leaf patterns. A simple press at the crown opened the cover. It was the most valuable item left by their father, a Royal Army Sergeant, though its second-hand nature meant it was perpetually temperamental, even after repeated repairs by watchmakers, causing Benson, who cherished it to elevate his status, frequent embarrassment. It was conveniently left behind at home.

One couldn't help but admire Melissa's potential mechanical aptitude. Having grasped the theoretical knowledge, she began experimenting with the tools from the technical school, recently claiming she had successfully repaired the watch!

Observing the cover open, Zhou Mingrui noted the second hand was momentarily stuck. He tried winding the crown, but no click indicated the mainspring was taut, and the second hand remained motionless.

_"Seems like it broke again,"_ he mumbled, looking at his sister.

Melissa glanced at him without expression, quickly approaching and snatching the watch.

Standing still, she first pulled up the crown button, turning it only a few clicks before the rhythmic ticking of the second hand resumed.

Normally, pulling the crown should adjust the time... Zhou Mingrui's expression froze in bewilderment.

At that moment, the distant cathedral bell tolled six times, its sound resonant and ethereal.

Melissa listened intently, then pushed the crown further up, twisting it repeatedly to set the time.

_"Done,"_ she stated succinctly, devoid of any inflection, before snapping the cover shut and handing the watch back to Zhou Mingrui.

Zhou Mingrui offered a strained but polite smile.

Melissa cast one last look at her brother, turned, and walked towards the cabinet, retrieving her toothbrush, towel, and other essentials before pulling the door open and heading to the shared bathroom.

_"That expression earlier... was it a mix of annoyance and resignation?"_

_"The look of pity towards a mentally challenged sibling?"_

Zhou Mingrui shook his head, chuckling to himself, snapped the watch cover shut with a *click*, then opened it again.

Repeating this mechanical action, his thoughts wandered to a question.

Without a silencer, Clarence's supposed suicide, yes, let's call it suicide for now, must have been quite loud. Yet, Melissa, living only a wall away, hadn't noticed a thing.

Was she too deeply asleep? Or was the act of suicide itself inherently strange?

*Click*, open. *Snap*, close. As Melissa returned from her wash, she witnessed her brother's unconscious ritual of opening and closing the watch cover.

Her gaze once again clouded with resignation, her voice sweet as she said, *"Clarence, take out the remaining bread. Remember to buy fresh ones today. And the meat and peas. You're heading to the interview soon; I'll make you pea stew with lamb."*

As she spoke, she pulled the stove from the corner, fanned the embers to light a kettle of water. Just before it boiled, she opened the lower cabinet drawer, carefully taking out a canister of inferior tea leaves, adding about a dozen to the pot, pretending it were genuine tea.

Pouring two generous cups, Melissa and Zhou Mingrui shared two black rye loaves with the tea. Lacking wood屑 and excessive麸质, yet still unpalatable... Zhou Mingrui, weakened and hungry, forced himself to swallow the bread despite its poor quality, aided by the tea.

A few minutes later, Melissa finished, tidied her black hair, and looked at Zhou Mingrui.

_"Remember to buy new bread, just eight pounds. It's hot; too much will spoil. Also, the lamb and peas. Don’t forget!"_

Indeed, caring for a bookish brother, even to the point of repetition... Zhou Mingrui smiled and nodded.

_"I will."_

Considering the Loen Kingdom's pound, Zhou Mingrui estimated it roughly equated to half a kilogram, akin to his familiar 'jin'.

Melissa said no more, prepared her lunch from the remaining bread, donned her late mother's worn-out veil, and took her own knapsack, sewn by herself, containing her books and stationery, ready to leave.

Today was not Sunday; she had to attend school for the entire day. The walk from their apartment to Ting Technical School took approximately fifty minutes, but public horse-drawn carriages offered transportation at a rate of one penny per kilometer, with a city limit of four pennies and six pennies for the suburbs. Melissa, ever thrifty, always chose to walk the distance.

Just as she opened the door, she paused, half-turning.

_"Clarence, no need to buy too much lamb and peas. Benson might not be back until Sunday. And yes, just eight pounds of bread."_

_"Alright, alright,"_ Zhou Mingrui replied helplessly.

Simultaneously, he silently repeated the word "Sunday" several times.

In the North大陸, the year was divided into twelve months, ranging from 365 to 366 days, and the week consistently consisted of seven days.

Astronomy suggested this was a parallel world, while religion confirmed the North大陸 recognized seven principal deities: the Eternal Sun, the Lord of Storms, the God of Knowledge and Wisdom, the Evernight Goddess, the Earth Mother, the God of War, and the God of Steam and Machinery.

Watching his sister close the door and leave, Zhou Mingrui let out a sigh, quickly shifting his focus to the divination ritual.

_"Sorry, I truly wish to return home..."*
