**Chapter Title:** The Dawn of a New Era

**English Draft:**

**Part 1: The Tempest at Sea**

Aaaah!
The wind howled, the rain fell in torrents, the three-masted ship surged between wave after wave, cresting and plunging, tossed like a toy by the giants of the sea.

Algernon Wilson’s eyes, once shadowed with a deep, unnerving red, seemed to fade, leaving him still standing on the deck, unchanged from before.

Then, he witnessed the peculiar glass bottle in his hand, grotesque in shape, shatter with a crisp *crack*. Frost, snow-like, melted into water, mingling with the raindrops.

In mere seconds, the ancient artifact was utterly gone, leaving no trace of its former existence.

A shard of crystalline snow, hexagonal in form, appeared in Algernon’s palm. It rapidly dissipated, vanishing as if receding into the flesh itself.

Algernon nodded almost imperceptibly, as if pondering something profound. He remained utterly still for five long minutes.

Turning his body, he walked towards the ship’s cabin entrance. Just as he was about to enter, he met a man stepping out, clad in a robe adorned with electric blue lightning patterns.

The man with the soft, honey-blonde hair paused, his gaze fixed on Algernon. He extended his right hand, fist clenched over his chest.

"Storm with you."

Algernon’s face, rugged and profound, devoid of any extraneous emotion, mirrored the gesture, clenching his own right fist over his left breast.

After exchanging formal greetings, Algernon entered the cabin, moving down the passageway towards the captain’s quarters beyond.

Throughout his journey, he encountered no sailors or crewmen. The ship was unnervingly silent, as still and empty as the interior of a tomb.

The captain’s door opened, revealing a plush, deep-brown carpet. Bookshelves and a liquor cabinet lined the sides. Yellowed bookbindings and dark, crimson wine bottles gleamed with an otherworldly light under the flickering candlelight.

On the candlelit desk sat an inkwell, a quill pen, a black metal telescope, and a brass sextant.

Behind the desk, a middle-aged man, pale-faced, wearing a skull captain’s hat, watched Algernon approach. His lips curled in fury as he ground his teeth.

"I will not yield!"

"You can do it," Algernon replied, his voice calm as if commenting on the day’s weather.

"You..." The man froze, utterly unprepared for such a response.

In that instant, Algernon’s body tensed, and he lunged forward, closing the distance between them to mere inches.

*Crack!*

His shoulder tightened, and his right hand shot out, clamping onto the man’s throat before he could react.

Phantomscales shimmered on his hand, and his fingers flexed with terrifying strength.

*Clink!*

With a sharp sound, the man’s eyes widened in shock as he was lifted entirely off his feet.

His legs thrashed violently, but his expression quickly settled into a blank stare. His pupils dilated, and the area beneath his trousers began to dampen, accompanied by a foul stench.

Algernon hoisted the man, bent his back, and took a stride towards the wall beside him.

*Thump!* He used the man as a shield, slamming him forcefully against the forward wall.

The wooden panels splintered and shattered. The狂暴的风雨, carrying the briny tang of the sea, surged into the cabin.

Algernon twisted his torso, and with a throw, he sent the man crashing out of the cabin and into the churning sea, cresting wave upon cresting wave.

Darkness, howling wind, and the raw power of nature swallowed everything.

Algernon pulled out a white handkerchief, wiped his right palm clean, and then tossed it into the sea.

Stepping back, he waited patiently for his companion to enter.

"What happened?" Within seconds, the man with the honey-blonde hair burst in.

"The Captain... escaped," Algernon panted, his tone tinged with frustration. "He still retains some...非凡之力!"

"Damn it!" The blonde man cursed under his breath.

He moved to the breach in the wall, staring intently into the distance. But all he saw was wind, rain, and the churning sea.

"Let it be," the blonde man waved a dismissive hand. "He was merely an incidental. Finding this Tudor ghost ship is our gain."

Even for a favored servant of the sea, he dared not risk venturing into the water in this weather.

"And if the storm continues," Algernon nodded, noting the visible, almost animate repair of the wooden wall. "The Captain won’t last much longer."

He cast a sidelong glance, his head twisting instinctively towards the helm and the sails.

Through layers of wood, he could perceive their state.

No first mate. No second mate. No sailors. No ordinary seamen. Not a single living soul.

The helm and sails adjusted themselves, silently and unnervingly.

A vision of the man obscured by grey and white mist, "The Fool," flashed in his mind. Algernon sighed, a sound of weary resignation.

He turned to the raging storm outside, his voice a fragmented whisper, laced with both anticipation and dread.

"A new era has begun..."

**Part 2: The Heart of the City**

In the Queen's Quarter, the capital of Loen Kingdom, Backlund, Audrye Holl nipped her cheek, unable to fathom what had just transpired.

Before her, the antique copper mirror on her dressing table lay in shattered fragments.

Lowering her gaze, Audrye saw the "Deep Red" flowing across her hand, like a tattoo of stars.

The "Deep Red" gradually faded, vanishing beneath her skin.

Only then did Audrye confirm that she was not dreaming.

Her eyes flickered with a liquid light, her lips curved slowly upwards. She stood, bending to gather her skirts.

With a curtsey to the empty air, Audrye moved with light steps, her body turning fluidly. She danced the "Ancient Elven Dance," the latest宫廷流行舞, a radiant smile blooming on her face.

*Tap-tap-tap!* The door to her room was knocked upon.

"Who is it?" Audrye stopped abruptly, assuming a demure posture.

"Miss, may I enter? It is time for you to prepare," her lady’s maid asked from outside the door.

Audrye glanced sideways at the broken mirror, quickly suppressing her smile, leaving only a faint line.

She examined herself left and right, satisfied with her appearance, then spoke softly.

"Enter."

Twisting her wrist, her lady’s maid, Annie, pushed the door open.

"Oh, it’s shattered…" Annie immediately noticed the state of the antique mirror.

Audrye blinked, her voice slow and deliberate.

"Well, yes, um, Susie was here, you know. It just… likes to break things!" Susie was a large, golden retriever with less than pure lineage, a gift from her father, Baron Holl, while hunting foxes, but dearly loved by Audrye.

"You need to discipline her properly," Annie said, expertly cleaning up the mirror shards, careful not to cut her mistress.

Finished, she looked at Audrye, a small smile playing on her lips.

"What dress would you like?"

"Ah, the one designed by Mistress Ginny for my seventeenth birthday," Audrye replied, thinking.

"No, that’s impossible. If someone were to see you wearing it again in a formal occasion, they would question the Holl family’s financial stability!" Annie shook her head.

"But I truly adore it," Audrye insisted, her tone gentle.

"You can wear it at home, in less formal settings," Annie stated firmly.

"Then the one Sir Sedus brought yesterday, the one with the lace at the sleeves," Audrye said, holding her breath, maintaining her elegant, sweet smile.

"You always have such excellent taste," Annie smiled, stepping back towards the door. "Number Six wardrobe, never mind, I’ll get it myself."

The maids sprang into action. One took charge of the gown, another of the jewels, another of the shoes, another of the silk hat, one for dressing Audrye, and one for considering the hairstyle.

As preparations wound down, the Baron, wearing a dark brown waistcoat and matching hat, with neatly trimmed sideburns, appeared at the doorway. His sapphire eyes held a cheerful glint, though the loose muscles, protruding belly, and deepening法令 lines marred the handsome man he once was.

"The jewel of Backlund, it is time to depart," Baron Holl announced, standing at the entrance, lightly tapping the open door.

"Father, please do not call me that," Audrye said, rising with her maid’s assistance, feigning a touch of vexation.

"Then, my lovely princess, it is time to go," the Baron bent his left arm, gesturing for her to take his arm.

Audrye offered a faint smile and shook her head.

"This is Lady Holl, your mother. Her place."

"Then this way," the Baron smiled, bending his right arm. "This is the pride of a father."

**Part 3: The Ironclad and the Age of Steam**

When Audrye, arm-in-arm with her father, descended from the carriage at Priz Port, Oak Island, Royal Naval Base, she was struck dumb by the behemoth before her.

In the nearby harbor lay a vessel of staggering proportions, its entire body shimmering with metallic glory. Gone were the sails, replaced by two towering smokestacks and two open-air gun turrets, one forward, one aft. It stood majestic, immense, dwarfing the nearby sailing battleships, which looked like mere children beside its colossus.

"By the storm..."

"Oh, my God."

"Ironclad!"

The murmurs rose, a low, collective gasp. Audrye felt the same awe, the wonder of human ingenuity, a miracle of the sea unlike any before.

It took an indeterminate time for the nobles, ministers, and members of the House of Commons to regain their composure. Just then, a black dot appeared in the sky, growing larger, blotting out a third of the heavens, commanding all attention and casting a sudden pall over the scene.

A colossal creature drifted and flew through the air. Its lines were incredibly fluid and elegant, painted in deep blue. A sturdy, light alloy frame supported the fabric housing airbags below, with casings for cannons, grenade launchers, and flat-trajectory guns visible on its underbelly. The cacophony of high-spirit steam engines and the frantic whirring of the propellers formed a symphony of awe-inspiring power.

The royal family’s airship had arrived, its descent marked by an air of supreme authority.

On either side of the carriage compartment, the "Judgment Sword" emblem, a vertical sword set with a ruby crown, reflected the sunlight. A symbol of the Augusta family, its legacy stretching back to the previous era.

Audrye, not yet eighteen, had not undergone the "Introduction Ceremony," the formal entry into Backlund’s social scene presided over by the Queen, signifying her adulthood. She could only observe from the sidelines, unable to approach.

Still, she paid it little mind, even feeling a sense of relief at not having to mingle with the princes.

The "miracle" of human flight settled onto the ground. First out climbed youthful guardsmen, clad in red uniforms and white trousers, bearing rifles, standing at rigid attention, forming two ranks as King George III and his family, along with the princes and princesses, emerged.

Audrye hadn’t seen royalty often, but she showed no interest. Her gaze drifted to the two black-armored knights standing beside the monarch, like stone statues.

In this age of steel, steam, and artillery, there were still men clad head-to-toe in armor!

The cold gleam of the metal, the deep black of the helmets, radiated a sense of weight, solemnity, and unquestioning obedience.

"Could they be the higher-tier 'Disciplinarian Knights'..." Audrye thought of idle conversations among her family’s elders. Curious, yet daunted, she dared not come closer.

With the king’s family arrived, the ceremony began. Lord Agughe Ngen, the current Secretary of State for War and the Navy, stepped forward.

A conservative figure, one of only two non-noble prime ministers to date, he had been elevated to Lord for his exceptional contributions.

But Audrye knew more. His elder brother, the mainstay of the Conservatives, was Lord Palas Ngen, the Duke of this generation!

Agughe, in his late fifties, thin and somewhat balding, with sharp, piercing eyes, surveyed the crowd.

"Ladies and gentlemen," he began, his voice resonating with authority. "You have seen it. This is an ironclad, a vessel capable of overturning the tides of history. Length: 101 meters. Beam: 21 meters. Height: Designed around the main deck. Main armor belt: 457mm thick. Displacement: 10,060 tons. Four 305mm main guns, forward and aft. Additionally, six rapid-fire guns, eighteen 6-pounders, and forty-six six-barreled machine guns. Four torpedo tubes. Speed: Up to 16 knots!"

"It shall be the undisputed master of the waves! It shall conquer the sea!"

Nobleman, ministers, and parliamentarians stirred uneasily. Even Agughe’s description painted a terrifying picture, but the sight of the vessel itself confirmed the horror.

A faint smile touched Agughe’s lips. He delivered a few more words before bowing to King George III.

"Majesty, it is time to name it."

"It shall be called 'Priz'," the King announced, his expression clearly pleased.

"Priz!"

"Priz!"

The name spread, passed from the Secretary of State, the Chief of the Naval Staff, onwards, until it reached the officers and men aboard the ironclad, who cheered in unison.

"Hail Priz!"

As celebrations erupted, salvos of artillery echoed through the air. King George III gave the order for departure and trials.

Aaaah!
The whistle blew, thick smoke billowed from the funnels, the sounds of machinery faintly audible.

The leviathan moved. As it cleared the port and opened fire on an uninhabited island ahead with its bow-mounted guns, everyone present gasped.

*BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!*

The earth seemed to tremble. Dust choked the air. A hurricane-force wind whipped across the water, tossing the waves into a frenzy.

Agughe Ngen turned, a satisfied smile on his face. He addressed the nobles, ministers, and parliamentarians.

"From this moment forth, those seven self-styled 'Generals' of piracy, those four who dared to usurp the title of King, can only tremble, awaiting their end!"

"Their era is over. No matter what 'extraordinary power' they may possess, no matter the ghost ships or curses, the sea shall be dominated by the ironclad!"

Just then, Agughe’s chief secretary interjected deliberately.

"But can they build such an ironclad themselves?"

Some nobles and members of parliament nodded silently, considering the possibility.

Agughe’s smile vanished, replaced by a slow shake of his head.

"No. Impossible. Utterly impossible! To construct such a vessel requires three large coal-steel integrated plants, twenty steelworks of a certain scale, the expertise of sixty scientists and countless senior engineers from the Backlund Ordnance Research Institute and the Priz Shipbuilding Research Institute. It demands two Royal Dockyards and their associated hundred-plus component factories, a Ministry of the Navy, a shipbuilding committee, a cabinet, a visionary and resolute monarch, and a nation capable of producing twelve million tons of steel annually!"

"They will never achieve it."

He paused, then raised his arms, his voice booming with fervor.

"Ladies and gentlemen, the age of the great ship and the great gun has dawned!"
