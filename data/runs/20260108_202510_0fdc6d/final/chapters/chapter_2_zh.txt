Okay, here is the revised English translation with corrected terminology, focusing on the specific issue raised and ensuring consistency for the mentioned terms:

**Chapter 2: Situation**

**Chunk 1**

*Thump-thump-thump!*

Zhou Mingrui recoiled, staggering back several steps. The sight before him was so shocking that it seemed the reflection in the **穿衣镜** (clothing mirror) wasn't of himself, but of a dried-up corpse.

A person with such grievous wounds could not possibly be alive!

Disbelieving, he tilted his head again, checking the other side, even though the distance increased and the image blurred. Yet, even with the diminished clarity, the **贯穿** wounds and the crimson bloodstains remained undeniable.

"Th…"
Taking a deep breath, Zhou Mingrui forced himself to calm down.
He reached out and pressed his hand firmly against his left chest, feeling the heart beneath leap and throb, strong and vigorous.
Then he touched the skin exposed by his shirt, feeling a faint coolness beneath which flowed a warmth.
Squatting down, he tested the flexibility of his knee before standing up again. The frantic edge had lessened.
"What in the name of—?" He frowned, whispering to himself, intending to examine the head wound more thoroughly.
Taking two steps forward, he paused abruptly. The light from the blood moon outside seemed too dim, insufficient for a proper inspection.

A fragment of memory surged unexpectedly. Zhou Mingrui turned his head towards the wall beside his desk, where a gas lamp was enclosed within a frame of grey pipes and metal grilles.
This was the current standard gaslight, its flame steady, its illumination excellent.
Considering the circumstances of his predecessor, **克莱恩·莫雷蒂** (Celenne Morty), acquiring even a kerosene lamp would have been stretching the truth; candles were the expected fare for someone of his station. Yet, four years prior, while **克莱恩·莫雷蒂** (Celenne Morty) had studied late into the night, preparing for the Khoy University entrance examinations, his brother, **班森** (Benson), believing it crucial for the family's future, had insisted on providing the necessary conditions, even borrowing money.
Of course, **班森** (Benson), literate and working for several years, was far from reckless, lacking in guile, or failing to consider the consequences. He had persuaded the landlord, Mr. French, to undertake the basic pipe installation by arguing that "installing gas pipes would enhance the apartment's prestige and aid in future rentals." And himself, leveraging his employment with an import/export company, had secured nearly cost-price gas lamps. In the end, he had managed it all with his savings alone, without borrowing from anyone.

The memory fragment flickered past. Zhou Mingrui returned to his desk, opening the valve on the pipe, then flicking the gas lamp switch.
*Click-click-click,* the friction-igniting mechanism clicked several times, but the expected light did not manifest as he had anticipated.
*Click-click-click!* He flicked the switch again, but the gaslight remained stubbornly dim.

"Hmm…" Shrinking his hand back, he pressed his left temple, drawing upon the fragmented memories to seek a cause.
Seconds later, he turned his body and walked towards the door, heading for the identical mechanical contraption mounted on the wall next to it, connected by the same grey pipes.
It was the **瓦斯计费器** (gas meter)!

Glancing at the exposed gears and bearings, Zhou Mingrui reached into his trouser pocket.
The coin he pulled out was a dull yellow, gleaming with copper lustre. The obverse bore the portrait of a man wearing a crown, the reverse featured wheat ears crowning the number "1".

Zhou Mingrui knew this was the most basic currency of the **鲁恩王国** (Loen Kingdom), called a **便士** (Penny). A Penny's purchasing power was roughly equivalent to three or four yuan before his arrival. There were also **半便士** (halfpennies) and **四分之一便士** (farthings), but they were still coarse denominations, often necessitating rounding up for everyday transactions.
After letting the George III penny he held rotate several times in his fingers, he rubbed it and inserted it into the vertical, slit-like "mouth" of the gas meter.

*Jingle-jangle!*
As the penny fell into the meter's interior, the sound of creaking gears immediately followed, playing a short, melodious mechanical tune.

He gazed for a few seconds, then returned to his desk, reaching out to flick the gas lamp switch again.
*Click-click-click, thump!*
A flame sprang up, rapidly growing larger. The bright light first filled the lamp globe, then spilled through the clear glass, bathing the room in a warm, almost inviting glow.

Darkness recoiled sharply. Crimson relinquished its hold on the window. Zhou Mingrui felt an inexplicable sense of reassurance wash over him. He hurried to the **穿衣镜** (clothing mirror).
This time, he scrutinized his temple meticulously, not missing a single detail.
After careful comparison, he found that aside from the initial bloodstains, the horrifying wound showed no further signs of bleeding. It seemed blessed with excellent **止血** (haemostasis) and bandaging. And the sluggish, creeping grey matter of the brain, coupled with the visibly knitting flesh of the wound, signalled the approach of healing. Perhaps in thirty or forty minutes, maybe two or three hours, only a faint mark would remain.

"Curative effects from the transition?" Zhou Mingrui quirked the corner of his right mouth, whispering silently.
He took a long, slow breath. Regardless of the cause, at least he was still very much alive!
Centering himself, he pulled out a small block of soap, took a worn towel hanging beside the cabinet, and selected one of them. Then, he opened the door and headed towards the second-floor common washroom for tenants.

Hmm, the bloodstains on his head needed attending to. He couldn't afford to look like a crime scene at every glance. It was bad enough if it scared himself, but if it frightened Melissa tomorrow morning, when she had to get up early for work, that would be a disaster indeed!
The hallway outside was pitch black, only the faint, crimson moonlight filtering through the window at the far end barely outlining the shapes protruding from the darkness, making them resemble countless monstrous eyes silently observing the living.
Zhou Mingrui lightened his footsteps, moving with a nervous tension towards the washroom.

Once inside, the moonlight was stronger, illuminating everything clearly. He stood before the sink and turned on the tap.
*Faucet water sound,* the noise entered his ears, and suddenly he recalled Mr. French, the landlord.
As water rates were included in the rent, the short, stout, thin man, perpetually wearing his top hat, waistcoat, and black formal coat, often bustled by to inspect the washrooms, listening intently for the sound of running water.
If the noise was particularly loud, Mr. French would disregard his gentlemanly decorum, furiously brandishing his walking stick, pounding on the washroom door, and shouting, "Damn thieves!" "Waste is a sin!" "I'll remember this!" "Let me catch you doing it again, and you can pack your dirty bags and get out!" "Believe me, this is the most reasonably priced apartment in Tingen City. You won't find a more generous landlord than me!"

Shaking his head clear, Zhou Mingrui wet the towel and began washing the bloodstains from his face, repeating the action several times.
After checking himself in the dilapidated washroom mirror, confirming that only the **狰狞伤口** (horrifying wound) and pale face remained, Zhou Mingrui felt a significant weight lift from his shoulders. He then removed his linen shirt and used the soap to scrub the bloodstains from his torso.
Just then, his brow furrowed. A new worry occurred to him:
The injuries were dramatic, the blood abundant. Besides himself, the room itself must be stained!
After a few minutes, Zhou Mingrui had cleaned his shirt. Holding the damp towel, he hurried back home. First, he wiped the bloodstains from his hands on the desk. Then, relying on the gas lamp's light, he searched for other traces.
His search yielded results almost immediately. There were numerous splatter stains on the floor and under the desk. And, on the left wall, near the floor, lay a single, bright yellow bullet casing.

"...Shot himself in the temple with a revolver?" The disparate clues suddenly connected in his mind. Zhou Mingrui guessed the cause of **克莱恩·莫雷蒂** (Celenne Morty)'s death.
He didn't rush to verify this immediately. First, he meticulously cleaned the bloodstains, tidied up the "scene," before picking up the casing and returning to his desk. He opened the revolver's cylinder and ejected the cartridges within.
*Clickety-clack,* five bullets and one empty casing lay there, gleaming with brass.

"Indeed…" Zhou Mingrui glanced at the empty casing, nodding slightly as he carefully reloaded each bullet into the cylinder.
His gaze shifted left, falling upon the open notebook where the words "All men must die, including me" were written. More questions churned within him.
Where did the gun come from?
Suicide, or a staged suicide?
What could have befallen a history graduate from a **平民** (commoner) family?
How did this method of suicide leave so little blood? Was it because his timely transition granted him some inherent **治愈** (healing)?
He pondered for a moment, then changed into another linen shirt and sat down in the chair, contemplating the truly crucial matters.
**克莱恩·莫雷蒂** (Celenne Morty)'s situation, while unfortunate, wasn't his primary concern. The real question was figuring out *why* he had transitioned and whether he could return!

Parents, relatives, friends, the lively online world, the variety of delicious food... These were all things he desperately wished to reclaim!
*Click, click, click...* Zhou Mingrui's right hand absently spun the revolver cylinder, then snapped it shut, repeating the action.
"Hmm, things haven't been drastically different from usual, just... unlucky. How could I suddenly transition without any warning?"
"Bad luck... Wait a minute, I performed a **转运仪式** (luck charm) before dinner tonight!"
A bolt of lightning flashed through his mind, illuminating the foggy memories obscured by the transition.
As a self-proclaimed "jack of all trades" in keyboard politics, history, economics, biology, and folklore, he was often derided by his friends as "a master of only a little bit of everything."
And among these "trades," **方术** (occult arts) were included.
Last year, returning to his hometown, he'd found an old, bound, vertical edition "**秦汉秘传方术纪要**" (**Treatise on Secret Transmission of Formulas and Techniques from the Qin and Han Dynasties**). Finding it intriguing, thinking it might help him "win arguments" online, he'd bought it. Unfortunately, his interest had faded quickly; the vertical script was difficult to read, and he'd only flipped through the beginning before shelving the book in the corner.
Now, after a string of misfortunes in the past month – losing his phone, a client backing out, a work error – he'd randomly remembered the luck charm mentioned at the start of the **方术纪要** (Treatise on Secret Transmission of Formulas and Techniques). It required nothing more than simple materials.
With nothing to lose, he retrieved the book, followed the instructions, and performed the ritual before his dinner. But nothing happened then.
Until the middle of the night, when he had transitioned!
He *had* transitioned!
"It's a definite possibility that the luck charm was responsible... Hmm, I'll try performing it here tomorrow. If it was indeed the cause, then perhaps there's a way back!" Zhou Mingrui stopped spinning the revolver, sitting up straight.
He had to try, no matter what. Even a dead horse is worth riding for a chance at a cure!
