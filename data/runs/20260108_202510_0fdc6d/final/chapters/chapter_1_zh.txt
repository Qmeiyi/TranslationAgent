**Chapter Title:** The Crimson Veil

**Content:**

Ouch!  
Oh, the pain! My head is splitting!

The dreams, filled with incoherent whispers, disintegrated in an instant. As Zhou Mingrui lay in slumber, his mind felt fragmented, as if struck by a blunt force, no, more like a sharp object piercing his temples, accompanied by a nauseating, unsettling stirring!

Hissing... groggily, Zhou Mingrui tried to turn, tried to clutch his throbbing temples, tried to sit up, but his limbs felt utterly unresponsive, as if his body had betrayed him.

It seems I am not fully awake yet, still lost in a dream... I’ve heard tales of those who mistake the edge of sleep for the peak of consciousness... Zhou Mingrui, no stranger to such occurrences, strained his will, desperate to break free from the shackles of darkness and illusion.

Yet, in this liminal state, his will felt as ethereal as mist, elusive and hard to grasp. Despite his efforts, his thoughts scattered, his mind clouded with stray thoughts.

What in the blazes? Why this sudden, agonizing headache in the dead of night?

Could it be... a cerebral hemorrhage? A stroke?  
Oh, blast it, am I about to meet my end prematurely?

Wake up! Wake up now!

Hmm, it seems the pain has lessened slightly? But my head feels as if a dull blade is slowly carving its way through...  
Enough of this. I cannot sleep anymore. How can I face the day?

Thinking of work... what good is work when I have this infernal headache? Of course, I’ll take the day off! No need to fear Boss Luo’s endless harangues!  
Aye, it’s not so bad, after all. A stolen half-day of respite!

Each jarring throb accumulated a phantom strength, until finally, Zhou Mingrui summoned his resolve, stiffened his spine, and opened his eyes, fully breaking free from the half-sleep.

His vision swam first, then blurred with a faint crimson hue. Focusing, he saw a plain wooden desk before him, a single notebook lying open in the center. The paper was rough and yellowed, the top page written in strange letters, the ink a deep, almost dripping black.

To the left of the notebook, near the desk edge, sat a neat stack of books, perhaps seven or eight volumes. To their right, the wall was adorned with grey-white pipes and a wall lamp connected to them—a fixture of Western classical design, roughly the size of a man’s head, with a transparent inner glass and a black metal grille surrounding it.

Below the lamp’s extinguished glow, a bottle of ink sat, its surface faintly aglow with a pale crimson light, the raised embossing forming indistinct angelic patterns.

Before the ink bottle, on the notebook’s right side, a sturdy, dark steel pen rested quietly, its tip shimmering with a soft light. Its cap lay beside a revolver, its barrel gleaming with a faint brass sheen.

A revolver? A six-shooter? Zhou Mingrui froze, utterly taken aback. The scene before him was utterly alien, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to his own room!

Disorientation and bewilderment washed over him as he noticed that the desk, the notebook, the ink bottle, even the revolver, seemed veiled in a thin, crimson "gauze"—a faint glow filtering in from outside.

Instinctively, he raised his head, letting his gaze slowly ascend:
In the air above, a dark "velvet curtain" stretched out, upon which hung a blood-red, full moon, serene and radiating.

This... Zhou Mingrui felt an inexplicable dread. He sprang to his feet, but before his legs could fully extend, another sharp pain seized him, stealing his strength, causing his center of gravity to falter. His backside slammed hard against the hard wood of the chair.

*Thump!*

The impact did little more than jolt him. Gripping the desk, Zhou Mingrui pushed himself upright, turning frantically to take in his surroundings.

The room was small, with doors on either side, and a wooden bunk bed pressed against the wall opposite. Between the left door and the bunk lay a cabinet with an upper shelf and five drawers below. At chest height on the left wall, another set of grey-white pipes ran, terminating in a peculiar mechanical contraption, its gears and bearings partially exposed.

Near the desk, a wooden corner held a coal stove and various kitchen utensils—pots, pans. Beyond the right door lay a cracked穿衣镜 (mirror), its wooden base simple and unadorned.

Glancing around, Zhou Mingrui caught sight of himself in the mirror—a figure of medium build, black hair, brown eyes, wearing a flaxen shirt, thin and with average features but deeper contours...

This... Zhou Mingrui let out a sharp inhale, his heart filled with a sense of utter helplessness and disarray. The revolver, the Western classical furnishings, and that crimson moon unlike any on Earth—all pointed to something profound.

Am I... have I crossed over? Zhou Mingrui’s mouth gaped slightly.

He’d grown up reading online fiction, often fantasizing about such scenarios, but the reality was a shock, leaving him momentarily unable to process.

Seconds later, a pang of bitterness twisted his lips—he mused self-deprecatingly, like the story of Yu Gong who admired dragons but was afraid of them.

Had the persistent pain kept his mind sharp, he might have doubted that this was merely a dream.

Calm down, calm down... Taking deep breaths, Zhou Mingrui fought to quell the rising panic.

Just then, as his mind and body settled, fragments of memory surged into his consciousness, presenting themselves slowly, one by one!

Zhou Mingrui. Born in Tingen City, Awwa County, Loen Kingdom, a recent graduate of Khoy University’s history department...

His father, a Royal Army sergeant, had died in a colonial conflict on the southern continent, his pension allowing Zhou Mingrui entry into a private grammar school, laying the foundation for university...

His mother, a devout follower of The Evernight Goddess, passed away the year he passed the Khoy University entrance exam...

He had an older brother and a younger sister, living together in a two-bedroom apartment...

The family was not wealthy, bordering on poverty, solely sustained by his brother’s job as a clerk in an import-export company...

As a history graduate, Zhou Mingrui possessed Ancient Feysac, the purported ancestor of all northern continent scripts, and Hermes, the ancient language often found in tombs, linked to sacrifice and prayer...

Hermes? Zhou Mingrui’s heart skipped a beat. He pressed his aching temple, his gaze fixed on the notebook. The strange letters on the yellowed paper began to shift, from alien to familiar, from familiar to decipherable.

This is written in Hermes!

The deep, almost dripping ink declared:

*“All mortals must die, including me.”*

Ssssh! Zhou Mingrui felt an inexplicable terror, instinctively recoiling, trying to distance himself from the notebook and those words.

He felt weak, nearly collapsing. He grabbed the desk edge, his trembling limbs steadying. The air around him seemed agitated, whispers faint yet pervasive in his ears, like childhood tales spun by elders to frighten children.

Shaking his head, he realized it was all a hallucination. He steadied himself, his breathing heavy, and tore his gaze from the notebook.

His eyes then fell upon the revolver, its brass gleam catching the light. A question suddenly struck him.

*“With Zhou Mingrui’s financial situation, how could he afford a revolver?”* Zhou Mingrui frowned.

Lost in thought, he noticed a half-fingerprint of blood on the desk’s edge, its colour darker than the moonlight, thicker than the gauze.

A bloodstain!

*“Bloodstain?”* Zhou Mingrui instinctively flipped open his right hand, peering down. His palm and fingers were smeared with blood.

Simultaneously, the headache returned, slightly lessened but persistent.

*“Did I hit my head?”* Zhou Mingrui wondered, turning his body towards the cracked mirror.

After a few steps, his reflection—a man of medium height, black hair, brown eyes, bearing the unmistakable air of study—came into clear view.

This... is me now, Zhou Mingrui?

Zhou Mingrui froze. The lighting was poor from the crimson moonlight, making it hard to discern. He stepped closer, almost colliding with the mirror.

Using the faint, gauzy moonlight, he tilted his head to inspect his temple.

The mirror, clear as a bell, showed a狰狞 (monstrous) wound nestled against his temple, its edges scorched, surrounded by blood.
