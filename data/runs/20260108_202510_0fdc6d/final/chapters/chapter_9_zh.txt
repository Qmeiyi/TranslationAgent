**Chapter Title:** Chapter 9: Notes

After resting for half an hour, Zhou Mingrui, having fully assumed the identity of Cai Lian Mo Rui, felt himself regain his composure. During this time, he discovered four black spots on the back of his right hand, arranged in a small square formation.

These four spots faded from darkness to light and vanished quickly, but Cai Lian knew they remained dormant within his body, waiting for the right moment to awaken.

"Four points, a square—does this correspond to the four cardinal directions and their respective main provisions? Perhaps I no longer need to prepare these staples and can directly proceed to the steps and incantations?" Cai Lian vaguely speculated.

It seemed like a promising idea, yet the presence of something inexplicable and foreign within him only intensified the fear. The thought that inexplicable occult practices from Earth could yield results here, coupled with his strange, inexplicable transition into this world, and the enigmatic, hallucinatory Grey Mist realm, all contributed to a chilling shiver that wracked him, even in the sweltering heat of late June.

He had once heard a saying: "Man's oldest and most profound emotion is fear, and the deepest of all fears is the fear of the unknown." Now, Cai Lian deeply felt the terror born from the unknown.

Unprecedented and uncontrollable, a strong impulse surged within him—a desire to delve into the mysteries, to learn more, to unravel the unknown. Yet, there was also a tendency to bury his head in the sand, pretending as if nothing had happened.

The sunlight streaming through the window cast a golden glow upon his desk, as if offering a touch of warmth and hope. He gazed at it, feeling a moment of respite. However, the exhaustion washed over him in an overwhelming tide.

The lack of sleep from the previous night and the recent expenditure of energy weighed heavily upon his eyelids, making them feel leaden and forcing them downward. He shook his head, reached out to support himself on the edge of the desk, and, ignoring the four corners where the rye bread lay, stumbled towards the bunk bed. As soon as he lay down and touched the pillow, he drifted into a deep sleep.

Gurgle! Gurgle!

Hunger awoke him. He opened his eyes, feeling refreshed.

"Besides the lingering headache," he rubbed his temples and sat up, suddenly feeling an appetite so strong he could devour an entire ox.

As he smoothed out the wrinkles in his clothes and returned to the desk, he picked up the silver watch with its vine-like pattern.

Click!

The cover snapped open, and the second hand ticked steadily.

"Half past twelve. I slept for more than three hours..." Cai Lian swallowed, placing the watch into the pocket of his linen shirt.

In the Loen Kingdom, time was divided into twenty-four hours, each hour sixty minutes, and each minute sixty seconds. Whether each second felt the same as on Earth, he could not know.

At that moment, even words like mysticism, rituals, or the Grey Mist world refused to enter his mind. The most pressing matter was sustenance—food! Without food, how could he devise a plan? How could he accomplish anything?

Without hesitation, Cai Lian retrieved the four loaves of rye bread, shook off the faint dust, and planned to use one as his midday meal. Due to his limited five pennies, and influenced by fragments of the original host's memories and habits, he felt it necessary to practice frugality.

After all, gas was too expensive, even for lighting. He moved the stove, added some coal, and paced back and forth, waiting for the water to boil.

Dry-eating rye bread was sure to cause discomfort!

"Ah, does this mean a life of rye bread for breakfast, lunch, and then meat for dinner? No, it’s not that bad. If it weren't for Melissa’s consideration for my upcoming interview, I could only afford meat once a week..."

Cai Lian looked around helplessly, his hunger preventing him from contemplating serious matters.

The thought of the one-pound lamb meat made his eyes take on a greenish hue as he stared at the cabinets.

"No, no, I must wait for Melissa to join me," he shook his head firmly, dismissing the idea of eating alone.

As a lone wanderer in the bustling city, though reliant on eating out, Cai Lian had honed his basic cooking skills. It wasn't gourmet, but it was sufficient.

Turning his body, Cai Lian decided to leave it at that, but just then, he remembered he had also purchased tender peas and potatoes earlier that morning.

Potatoes! Inspiration struck him instantly. He spun around, rushed to the cabinets, and took out two of the few potatoes he had.

He went to the public restroom, washed the potatoes clean, and placed them directly into the pot with the water.

After a while, he retrieved the spice box from the cabinet, opened the lid, and sprinkled a little yellow, coarse salt into the water.

Patiently waiting a few more minutes, Cai Lian poured the thin soup-like liquid into several cups and a large bowl, then took out the potatoes with a fork and placed them on the table.

Huff!

As he peeled a bit of the skin and blew on his hand, the aroma of the cooked potatoes slowly弥漫ed, enticing his appetite.

Saliva flowed uncontrollably. Ignoring the fact that he had only peeled half and the potatoes were still hot, he took a large bite.

Powdered, fragrant, with a hint of sweetness on the palate! Cai Lian's heart swelled with emotion. He devoured the two potatoes with gusto, even eating the skin.

Only then did he pick up the large bowl and take a satisfying sip of the "soup," the faint saltiness cleansing the dryness in his mouth.

"Back when I was a child, I loved this the most..." Cai Lian silently reflected, breaking the rye bread and dipping it into the "soup" to soften it before eating.

Perhaps the previous "ritual" had drained him significantly, as he consumed two loaves, an entire pound. After drinking the "soup" and tidying up, Cai Lian felt truly revitalized, experiencing the joy of being human and basking in the warmth of the sunlight.

He returned to his desk and began to ponder his next steps.

"I cannot evade this. I must find a way to engage with the mysterious domain, to become a 'Beyonder' recognized by 'Justice' and 'The Hanged Man'."

"I must overcome the fear born from the unknown."

"The only path available at the moment is to wait for the next 'gathering,' hoping to overhear the 'Audience Potion' recipe or other esoteric knowledge."

"There are still four days until Monday. Before then, I must confront the issues inherent in the original host. Why did he commit suicide? What happened to him?"

Unable to return to his original world and simply walk away, Cai Lian picked up the open notebook and decided to flip through it, hoping to find clues that might piece together the fragmented memories.

Clearly, the original host had a habit of taking notes and treating them as a diary.

Cai Lian knew that the cabinet beneath his desk was filled with countless completed notebooks.

This particular one started from May 10th, its contents initially focused on school, professors, and academic topics:

"May 12th: Mr. Azir mentioned that the common language of the southern continent's Bayren Empire also originates from Ancient Feysac, a branch of the Giant language. Why is that? Could all sentient beings have once spoken the same language? No, this must be wrong. Even according to the 'Night Revelation' and 'The Book of Storms,' in an era older than antiquity, giants were not the sole rulers of the continents; there were also elves, aberrations, and dragons. Well, these are just legends, mythological stories."

...

"May 16th: I discussed the inevitability of the Steam Age with Senior Professor Cohen and Mr. Azir. Mr. Azir believed it was a matter of chance; without the sudden appearance of Emperor Rosier, perhaps the North Continent would still be in the same state as the South, remaining in the age of cold兵器. My professor, however, felt he overstated the role of individuals. He believed that with the progression of time, without Rosier or Emperor Robert, the Steam Age might be delayed but would eventually arrive. Their debate seemed to me to lack significance. I prefer to discover new things and uncover the obscured history. Perhaps, I shouldn't have studied history; maybe archaeology would be more suitable."

...

"May 29th: Welch found me and said he had obtained a notebook from the Fourth Era. My goddess, a notebook from the Fourth Era! He didn't want to bother his archaeology friends and asked me and Naya for help in deciphering its contents. How could I refuse? Of course, it had to be after the graduation defense, as I couldn't afford to be distracted at this time."

Here, Cai Lian's spirits lifted. Compared to the historical notes and debates on ideologies, this newly discovered "Fourth Era" notebook was more likely to explain the original host's suicide.

The Fourth Era was the epoch preceding the current Black Iron Era, shrouded in mist and missing many details. Even the tombs, ancient cities, and documents from that period were scarce. Historians and archaeologists could only piece together a faint outline through the ambiguous theological texts of the Seven Churches, which were primarily faith-based education. They knew of the Solomon Empire, the Tudor Dynasty, and the T'lan C'thur Empire.

Cai Lian, determined to unravel the mist and restore history, had little interest in the "Third Era" or earlier, which leaned more towards mythology. His excitement was palpable.

"Well, upon closer inspection, the original host's concern for the interview and future employment was unnecessary..."

Universities were still relatively scarce, and the vast majority of students were nobility or wealthy children. While commoners faced discrimination and exclusion from social circles, they could still build valuable人脉 through group discussions and collective activities.

For example, Welch McGowan, son of a banker in Kingdonshire, Intershire, was known for his generosity. Due to their habit of working together on assignments and reports with Cai Lian and Naya, he often treated them.

With his mind wandering, Cai Lian continued reading the notes:

"June 18th: Graduation. Farewell, my Khoy University!"

"June 19th: I examined that notebook. Through structural and root comparisons, I determined it was a variant of Ancient Feysac. More precisely, Ancient Feysac had been subtly evolving for over a thousand years."

"June 20th: We deciphered the first page's content. The author belonged to a family named 'Antigonus'."

"June 21st: He mentioned the 'Black Emperor.' This contradicted the era deduced from the previous content. Could my professor be wrong? Was the 'Black Emperor' a title held by every emperor of the Solomon Empire?"

"June 22nd: The family named 'Antigonus' held significant status within the Solomon Empire. The notebook's owner mentioned engaging in a secret transaction with someone named Tudor. Tudor? Tudor Dynasty?"

"June 23rd: I forced myself not to think about that notebook, not to go to Welch's place. I must prepare for the interview! It's a very important matter!"

"June 24th: Naya told me they had new findings. I think I should go and see what they discovered."

"June 25th: Based on the newly deciphered content, the notebook's owner accepted a mission to travel to the summit of the 'Horachies' Mountains to visit the 'Land of Night' at its peak. My goddess, the summit of the Horachies Mountains exceeds six thousand meters—how could a country exist there? How do they survive?"

"June 26th: Are all these strange things real?"

The notebook ended there, and Zhou Mingrui had arrived on this world on the early morning of June 28th.

"So, the notes from June 27th must exist. It was probably that sentence... 'Everyone will die, including me...'"

Cai Lian turned to the first page he had seen, making a judgment that sent a chill down his spine.

To unravel the mystery of the original host's suicide, he should visit Welch and examine the ancient notebook. However, drawing from his experience in novels, films, and TV shows, he suspected that if he went, and if the matter was indeed connected, he would likely face unknown dangers—those who recklessly ventured into haunted castles served as a stark warning!

Yet, he could not avoid it. Avoidance would never solve the problem; it would only allow the issue to grow, accumulate, and eventually overwhelm him completely.

Should he call the authorities? He couldn't very well tell them he had committed suicide.

Knock! Knock knock!

A sharp, forceful knock echoed at the door.

Cai Lian sat upright, straining to listen.

Knock!

Knock knock!

The knocking reverberated through the empty, desolate hallway.
