**Chapter Title:** Chapter 7: Code Name

**English Draft:**

"The Fool," the concise answer faded into the vast sanctuary and the pervasive mist, yet within the hearts of Audrey and Archer, its echoes lingered, stirring ripple upon ripple of profound reverberation.

Unexpected, yet fittingly so. A title that perfectly encapsulated mystery, power, and strangeness!

A brief silence ensued, broken by Audrey rising. She lifted the hem of her skirt lightly, bent her knees, and offered a formal salute to Zhou Mingrui.
"Esteemed Sir The Fool, allow me the audacity to beseech you: could you serve as a witness to our transaction?"
"Trivial matter," Zhou Mingrui thought swiftly, replying in a manner befitting his station.
"It is an honour, Sir The Fool," Archer echoed, rising and bowing with his right hand over his heart.

Zhou Mingrui waved his right hand dismissively, a faint smile touching his lips as he spoke.
"You continue," he said.

Archer nodded, resettling himself, then turned to Audrey.
"If you can acquire the Ghost Shark's blood, arrange for it to be sent to the 'Warriors and Sea' tavern on Pelican Street, in the White Rose District of Prizzi Port. Inform the owner, Williams, that this is 'Captain's' request."

"How do you intend to proceed?" Zhou Mingrui inquired, his mind racing to formulate a response. "Will you provide me with the address and mail the potion recipe forward, or shall you convey the recipe here directly?"

Audrey pondered for a moment, a smile finally blooming on her face.
"I choose the more discreet method," she declared, "here and now, though it certainly tests the limits of one's memory."

Should Sir The Fool agree to witness the transaction, it implied the potential for recurring 'gatherings' in the future.
A thought struck her, turning her head with a spark in her eyes as she playfully suggested,
"Sir The Fool, would you mind partaking in such 'experiments' more frequently?"

Archer, listening intently, felt a thrill of excitement. Hastily, he concurred.
"Sir The Fool, do you not find these 'gatherings' most intriguing? Though your power surpasses our wildest imaginations, there remain domains unfamiliar and perhaps beyond your expertise. That lady, clearly of noble birth, possesses her own unique experiences, knowledge, channels, and resources. Between us, we might accomplish certain tasks, those perhaps unsuitable for you to undertake directly."

He reasoned that his own unprepared and defenseless inclusion in this circle signified the Sir's dominant control. Resistance or disengagement were not viable options. Therefore, it was wiser to delve deeper into the benefits of this encounter, to harvest advantages from the perceived disadvantage.

Three distinct individuals sat around the long table, each possessing disparate backgrounds, resources, information channels, and understanding of the occult. Mutual exchange and limited cooperation could yield results of incalculable and immeasurable wonder!

Consider the resource exchange just agreed upon. Should he wish to eliminate an individual, for instance, he could readily enlist the aid of a 'gatherings member' seemingly unrelated to the matter, ensuring the affair would be misconstrued entirely.

The noble lady... Had my demeanor, my accent, betrayed my origins so plainly? Audrey's mouth parted slightly, her mind momentarily stunned. Yet, she quickly regained her composure, nodding decisively.
"Sir The Fool, I believe this is an excellent proposal. Provided the 'gathering' becomes a regular affair, certain tasks for which you might be unwilling or unsuited to handle directly could be delegated to us. Naturally, within our capabilities."

From the outset, Zhou Mingrui had been weighing the pros and cons. More 'gatherings' undoubtedly promised greater access to anomalous mysteries and esoteric knowledge, potentially aiding his return journey in the future. Consider the potion recipe for 'The Spectator' expected to appear at the next gathering. Simultaneously, such meetings could provide intelligence and tangible assistance for his present reality.

Yet, increased gatherings also heightened the risk of exposing his true nature!

Indeed, no matter the world, there existed no purely beneficial undertaking.

Zhou Mingrui extended his right hand again, lightly tapping the edge of the long table.

Given that the convening and dissolution of the 'gathering' remained under his purview, any potential exposure could be managed. The benefits clearly outweighed the drawbacks, leading to a swift decision.

He ceased his tapping, meeting the four expectant yet apprehensive gazes with a faint smile.
"I am one who values equitable exchange," he stated.
"I shall not allow you to assist without reciprocity."

"Each Monday, at three o'clock," he continued, "ensure solitude. After I have conducted a few more trials and clarified certain matters, perhaps you will be able to attend earlier, avoiding unsuitable circumstances."

This constituted agreement to Archer and Audrey's proposal.

Audrey, barely seventeen, accustomed to pampered indulgence, felt a thrill of anticipation. Gripping her hands into fists, she lightly swayed them over her chest.
"Then, should we not assign ourselves codenames? After all, using our real names would be imprudent."

Although her true circumstances might not escape Sir The Fool's notice, the other party also posed a certain danger; she could not risk revealing her identity!

"An excellent suggestion," Zhou Mingrui replied succinctly and lightly.

Audrey immediately set to pondering, elaborating her thoughts.
"You are Sir The Fool, originating from the Tarot. As a regular, long-term, clandestine 'gathering', our titles ought to be consistent, yes? I shall select mine from the Tarot as well."

Her tone gradually lightened.
"Determined! My title shall be, 'Justice'!"

One of the twenty-two Major Arcana cards.

"And for you, sir?" Audrey asked, her eyes sparkling as she looked at the 'associate' opposite her.

Archer frowned slightly, then relaxed.
"The Hanged Man."

Another Major Arcana.

"Excellent," Audrey exclaimed, a hint of shyness creeping into her voice as she turned to Zhou Mingrui, obscured by the grey-white mist. "Shall we consider ourselves the founding members of the Tarot Circle?"
"Is there any objection, Sir The Fool?" she inquired.

Zhou Mingrui shook his head with a faint amusement.
"Concerning such trivialities, you are empowered to decide for yourselves."

"Thank you!" Audrey's excitement was palpable.

She then turned to Archer.
"Mr. The Hanged Man, might you repeat the address, please? I fear my memory may not retain it sufficiently."

"No problem," Archer replied, satisfied with Audrey's diligence. He repeated the address.

After silently reciting it three times, Audrey continued with renewed enthusiasm.
"I've heard that the Tarot was merely a game invented by Rosier Emperor, possessing no actual divination capabilities?"

"No," Archer countered, glancing at Zhou Mingrui who gave no indication to intervene. "Divination often stems from within. Each individual possesses a spirit, capable of perceiving the spirit realm, sensing information from higher levels. However, common folk cannot perceive this, let alone interpret the 'hints' received. When they employ divination tools, these messages manifest through them. A simple example is dreams and dream interpretation." He continued, "The Tarot is essentially such a tool. It utilizes more symbolic elements and rational components to facilitate the convenient and accurate interpretation of 'hints'."

Zhou Mingrui appeared nonchalant, yet his mind processed the information meticulously. However, his spiritual disconnection intensified, a sharp, pulsating pain lancing through his skull.

"Understood," Audrey nodded, seeking clarification. "My meaning was not that. I am not questioning the Tarot's validity. I have heard whispers that Rosier Emperor actually devised a hidden set of cards, symbolizing certain unknown forces, a deck of twenty-two cards. Only after completing this did he formulate the twenty-two Major Arcana cards we know today, using them as a game mechanism. Is this accurate?"

She regarded Zhou Mingrui, hoping for an answer from the enigmatic Sir.

Zhou Mingrui merely smiled, offering no verbal response, his gaze shifting towards 'The Hanged Man', as if testing him.

Archer instinctively straightened his posture, speaking with a measured tone.
"Yes, it is said Rosier Emperor viewed the profane stone tablet, and that deck of cards concealed the secrets of the twenty-two **Pathways of the Gods**."

"Twenty-two **Pathways of the Gods**..." Audrey repeated, her voice imbued with a tone of profound awe.

At that moment, Zhou Mingrui's headache intensified, the invisible connection between himself and the Crimson Star, the Grey Haze, feeling unstable.

"Enough for today," he decreed decisively, his voice low and final.

"Your will is our command," Archer bowed his head.

"Your will is our command," Audrey echoed, imitating 'The Hanged Man'.

She had countless questions and ideas, unwilling to part so soon.

As he severed the connection, Zhou Mingrui offered a faint smile.
"Let us anticipate the next gathering."

The 'Stars' lightened, the crimson glow receding like water. Before Audrey and Archer could fully grasp the 'Fool's' words, their forms began to blur, becoming increasingly ethereal.

In less than a second, the 'projection' dissolved, leaving the Grey Haze utterly silent once more.

Zhou Mingrui felt a sudden heaviness, as if his body had become lead. The surroundings seemed to drift away, darkness enveloping his vision before brilliant sunlight pierced through.

He remained within his apartment, standing in the center of the room.

"A dream... what exactly is that Grey Haze place? Who, or what force, orchestrated that transformation...?" Zhou Mingrui murmured softly, a profound sense of bewilderment washing over him. His legs felt weighted, dragging him towards the desk.

He retrieved the watch he had placed outside, checking the elapsed time.

"One-to-one temporal flow," he estimated.

Setting the watch down, the excruciating pain in his head made further resistance futile. He sank into the chair, lowering his head and using his left thumb and index finger to massage the temples on either side of his head.

After a long moment, a sigh escaped him. He spoke in Chinese.
"Apparently, I cannot return anytime soon..."

The uninformed could be reckless. Having witnessed such marvels, gained insight into the anomalous domains and esoteric realms, Zhou Mingrui dared not attempt the 'Fortune-Changing Ritual' in Ancient Feysac or Ruin again!

Who knew what other, perhaps more bizarre, more terrifying, even life-ruining, scenarios might arise!

"At least, not until I have a thorough grasp of the occult," he thought helplessly.

Still, the so-called 'gatherings' offered him assistance.

A heavy silence settled upon him. With a mixture of frustration, disappointment, pain, and melancholy, he murmured to himself.
"From this point forward, I shall be克莱恩."

...

克莱恩 forced his thoughts towards plans and strategies, endeavoring to dispel the negative emotions churning within him.

Next week, perhaps, he could overhear the recipe for 'The Spectator' potion...

That 'gathering' had been quite remarkable. People from different parts of the world, bridging thousands of miles as if mere inches apart, face-to-face interaction, bartering goods and services... it sounded familiar.

克莱恩 paused for a few seconds, suddenly chuckling to himself. He pressed his temple with his hand, whispering a self-mocking remark.
