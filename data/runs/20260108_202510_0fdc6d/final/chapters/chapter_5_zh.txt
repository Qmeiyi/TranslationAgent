**Chapter Title:** Chapter 5: The Ritual

**Original Content:**

Free? Free things are the most expensive! Zhou Mingrui muttered silently, determined to reject any additional services that might come up later.
Brave enough to divine that I’m a **traveller from another world**? (Translator’s Note: “穿越者” refers to someone who has “crossed over,” typically meaning someone who has traveled through time or space, often used for characters who have been transported to another world.)
He followed the woman with red and yellow face paint, bending down and entering the low tent.
The interior of the tent was extremely dark, with only a dim and scarce light filtering in, barely illuminating a table covered in tarot cards.
The woman, wearing a pointed hat, was completely unfazed. Her black skirt flowed like water around the table, and she sat opposite him, lighting a candle.
The candlelight flickered and cast a dim, uncertain glow throughout the tent, instantly adding a sense of mystery.
Zhou Mingrui sat down without a sound, his gaze sweeping over the tarot cards on the table. He recognized familiar Major Arcana cards such as “The Magician,” “The Emperor,” “The Hanged Man,” and “Temperance.”
“Comrade Rosterman could really be ‘an elder’... I wonder if he’s from my old country, the Great Empire...” Zhou Mingrui’s lips twitched slightly, a moment of daze washing over him.
He hadn’t had time to examine all the cards laid out on the table when the woman, claiming her divinations were highly accurate, had already gathered all the tarot cards together, stacked them into a pile, and pushed them in front of him.
“You wash and shuffle the cards.” The circus fortune-teller’s voice was low and hoarse.
“I wash?” Zhou Mingrui asked instinctively.
The fortune-teller’s red and yellow face paint seemed to shift, revealing a faint smile. “Of course. Only you can divine your own fate; I am merely an interpreter.”
Zhou Mingrui immediately became wary and asked, “Does interpretation come with an extra charge?”
As a keyboard folklorist, I’ve seen plenty of tricks like this!
The fortune-teller seemed taken aback for a moment, then grumbled, “For free.”
Zhou Mingrui breathed a sigh of relief. He stuffed his left-hand pocket with another round of bullets from his revolver. Then, he placed his palms on the table, shuffling and cutting the cards with practiced ease.
“Done.” He placed the shuffled tarot cards in the center of the table.
The fortune-teller crossed her hands, studying the cards attentively for a moment, then spoke. “Sorry, I forgot to ask. What do you wish to divine?”
Back when he was pursuing his failed **first love**, Zhou Mingrui had studied tarot cards. He answered without hesitation: “The past, the present, and the future.”
This was a three-card tarot spread, with each card representing the past, present, and future respectively.
The fortune-teller nodded first, then her lips curved upward into a smile. “Then please shuffle the cards again. Understand what you wish to ask before shuffling, so that the cards may yield truly symbolic meanings.”
You just played me! How petty is that? Wasn’t it just because I kept emphasizing that it was free?
Zhou Mingrui’s facial muscles twitched. He took a deep breath and retrieved the tarot cards, shuffling and cutting them once more.
“Should be fine this time,” he said, placing the cut cards on the table.
“There’s no more,” the fortune-teller said, extending a finger to pick up the top card and place it to Zhou Mingrui’s left. Her voice grew even lower and hoarser. “This card symbolizes the past.”
“This one symbolizes the present.” She placed the second card in front of Zhou Mingrui.
She picked up the third card and placed it to Zhou Mingrui’s right: “This one symbolizes the future.”
“Alright, which one would you like to see first?” Once she finished, the fortune-teller raised her head, her hazel eyes gazing deeply into Zhou Mingrui’s.
“Let’s start with the ‘present’ card,” Zhou Mingrui said after a moment’s thought.
The fortune-teller nodded slowly and turned over the card in front of him.
The card depicted a young man dressed in splendid clothes, wearing an ornate headpiece, carrying a staff over his shoulder, with luggage hanging from the top of the staff. A small dog pulled at his heels. The number “0” was printed on the card.
“The Fool,” the fortune-teller whispered, her hazel eyes fixed on Zhou Mingrui.
The Fool? The zero card of Tarot? The beginning? The encompassing of all possible beginnings?
Zhou Mingrui, who wasn’t even a beginner in tarot, made a superficial interpretation based on his limited knowledge.
Just as the fortune-teller was about to speak, the tent flap was suddenly thrown open, letting in bright sunlight that forced Zhou Mingrui, who was facing away, to instinctively squint.
“You’re here again, impersonating me! Divination is my job!” A woman’s voice, angry and low, roared. “Go back! Remember, you are nothing but a circus animal trainer!”
Circus animal trainer? Zhou Mingrui adjusted to the light and saw a woman of similar stature, wearing a pointed hat, a black skirt, and red and yellow face paint, standing at the entrance. She was taller and thinner than the one he had just spoken to.
The woman in front of him stood up quickly, looking somewhat crestfallen.
“I apologize, but I simply enjoy this. I must say, sometimes my divinations and interpretations are quite accurate. Truly…”
As she spoke, she lifted her skirt and hurriedly walked around the table, disappearing into the tent.
“Sir, would you like me to interpret something for you?” The real fortune-teller turned to Zhou Mingrui, smiling.
Zhou Mingrui moved his lips slightly and asked sincerely, “For free?”
“…No,” the real fortune-teller replied.
“Then I’ll pass,” Zhou Mingrui said, sliding his hand back into his pocket, pressing the revolver and some coins. He bent down and stepped out of the tent.
This is ridiculous. Finding a circus animal trainer to do tarot divination!
If you’re not a good clown, you shouldn’t pretend to be one!
Zhou Mingrui quickly pushed the incident aside. At the “Lettuce and Meat” market, he bought 1 pound of subpar lamb meat for 7 pennies, along with tender peas, cabbage, onions, potatoes, and other items. Adding the bread he had bought earlier, the total cost was 25 copper pennies, equivalent to 2 Soli and 1 Penny.
“What rotten money, **Benson**…” Zhou Mingrui muttered casually, no longer thinking about it. He hurriedly returned home.
With the main ingredients, it was time to perform the ritual!
…
After the upstairs tenants had all left, Zhou Mingrui didn’t rush to perform the ritual. Instead, he first translated the terms “Fu Sheng Xuan Huang Xian Zun” and others into Old Fasak and Loen Kingdom dialects. He planned to try the original spell first; if it didn’t work, he would try translating it into the local language the next day!
After all, he had to consider the differences between the two realms and follow the local customs.
As for translating it into the ancient prayers and sacrifices used in Hermes, Zhou Mingrui found it difficult due to his limited vocabulary.
Once he finished this, he took out four rye loaves from the paper bag. He placed one in the corner where the coal stove used to be, one at the bottom of the wardrobe on the inside, one at the junction of the two walls on the top shelf, and one in the cluttered area near his desk.
Taking a deep breath, Zhou Mingrui walked to the center of the room. He calmed himself for a few minutes before taking a solemn step, moving in a counterclockwise square.
On the first step, he whispered: “Fu Sheng Xuan Huang Xian Zun.”
On the second step, he sincerely muttered: “Fu Sheng Xuan Huang Tian Jun.”
On the third step, Zhou Mingrui held his breath and whispered: “Fu Sheng Xuan Huang Shang Di.”
On the fourth step, he exhaled and silently recited: “Fu Sheng Xuan Huang Tian Zun.”
Returning to his starting position, Zhou Mingrui closed his eyes and waited on the spot, his heart filled with anticipation, unease, hope, and fear.
Could he return?
Would the ritual be effective?
Would something unexpected happen?
The darkness before his eyes seemed to tinge with the red of the light, and the thoughts swirling in his mind were chaotic and could not be calmed.
Just then, he suddenly felt as if the air around him had stopped moving, becoming viscous and eerie.
Following this, a low murmur entered his ears, one that was sometimes subtle, sometimes sharp, sometimes ethereal, sometimes tempting, sometimes restless, sometimes mad. Even though he couldn’t understand the whispers, Zhou Mingrui couldn’t help but listen and try to discern their meaning.
His head began to ache violently, as if a steel spike had been driven into it.
Zhou Mingrui felt his head would burst. His thoughts were clouded with a hallucinatory haze.
He knew something was wrong. He tried desperately to open his eyes but couldn’t manage even the simplest action.
His whole body grew increasingly tense, as if ready to snap. Out of nowhere, a self-mocking thought crossed his mind:
“If you don’t seek death, you won’t find it…”
Unable to bear it any longer, just as the string in his mind was about to snap, the cacophony of voices and whispers receded. The surrounding area became incredibly quiet, the atmosphere strangely ethereal.
Not only the atmosphere, but Zhou Mingrui also felt his body becoming similarly ethereal.
He tried to open his eyes once more, and this time, it was effortless.
A translucent mist, gray and boundless, entered his vision.
“What is this?” Zhou Mingrui looked around in astonishment, then looked down and saw himself floating on the edge of an endless gray mist.
The mist flowed like water, dotted with countless deep red “stars.” Some were large, some were small, some were hidden deep within, and others floated on the surface.
Observing this holographic-like scene, Zhou Mingrui extended his right hand hesitantly, half in confusion and half in exploration, attempting to touch one of the deep red “stars” floating on the surface to the right, hoping to find a way to leave.
As soon as his fingers touched the surface of the red “star,” ripples surged from his body, startling the “star” into an eruption, like a dreamlike fireworks display.
Zhou Mingrui jumped in fright and hastily withdrew his hand. In the process, he accidentally brushed against another “star.”
That “star” also flared into light.
Zhou Mingrui felt his head empty and his spirit scattered.
…
In the capital city of Loen Kingdom, Backlund, within a luxurious villa in the Queen’s Quarter.
Audrey Holm sat in front of her dressing table, stroking an ancient, cracked copper mirror on the table.
“Magic mirror, wake up…”
“I command you in the name of the Holm family to awaken!”
…
She tried various phrases, but the mirror remained unresponsive.
After more than ten minutes, she finally gave up, pouting in frustration and muttering softly:
“Dad was indeed deceiving me. He always tells me this mirror is a treasure of the ancient Solian Empire’s Black Emperor, a supernatural item.”
As soon as she finished speaking, the copper mirror on the table suddenly emitted a deep red glow, enveloping her instantly.
…
On the Sini Sea, a three-masted sailing ship, clearly outdated, navigated through a violent storm.
Algernon Wilson stood on the deck, his body swaying with the ship’s movements, effortlessly maintaining his balance.
Dressed in a long robe adorned with lightning patterns, he held a strangely shaped glass bottle. Bubbles occasionally churned within the bottle, frost sometimes condensed into snow, and sometimes, the bottle seemed to be carved by the wind.
“I still need the blood of a ghost shark…” Algernon muttered.
Just then, a deep red light erupted between the glass bottle and his hand, instantly engulfing the surrounding area.
…
Above a field of gray and white mist, Audrey Holm’s vision returned. She looked left and right in fear and confusion. Across from her, a man with a blurred head and indistinct figure was doing the same.
Almost simultaneously, they both noticed a mysterious figure, surrounded by a gray mist, standing not far away.
Zhou Mingrui was equally stunned.
“Sir, where are we?”
“What do you intend to do?”
Audrey and Algernon were both taken aback, falling silent for a moment, before speaking in unison.
