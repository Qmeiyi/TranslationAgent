The same Runian language, the same heavy and tense feeling.
Where is this? What am I supposed to do? I wonder too... Zhou Mingrui composed himself and silently repeated the questions posed by the two individuals.
What struck him most profoundly, however, was not the sentences formed by the words, nor the meanings they held, but the palpable panic, vigilance, fear, and reverence exhibited by the man and the woman!
Unthinkingly pulling two people into this expanse of grey mist, even as the "culprit" himself felt an unprecedented shock and disbelief, let alone those who were merely passive participants!

From their perspective, such an event, such an encounter, must surely transcend the bounds of imagination, wouldn't it?
In that very instant, Zhou Mingrui contemplated two choices. One was to pretend he was also a victim, conceal his true identity, and thereby secure a measure of trust to observe the unfolding events, to navigate the murky waters unobtrusively. The other was to maintain the enigmatic and inscrutable image they perceived, actively steering the course of events to extract valuable information.

There was no time for further contemplation or meticulous weighing of options. Seizing upon the fleeting thought that had crossed his mind, Zhou Mingrui swiftly made his decision, opting for the second course of action.
Leverage their current psychological state and seize the greatest advantage!

A brief silence hung in the grey mist above. Zhou Mingrui let out a soft chuckle, his tone calm and unassuming, his voice low but not heavy, as if responding to a polite inquiry from visitors:
"A trial."
A trial... A trial? Audrey Hall stared at the enigmatic man obscured by the grey mist, finding the situation absurd, laughable, horrifying, and bizarre all at once.
She had been in her bedroom, standing before her dressing table, and in the blink of an eye, she had "come" to this place teeming with grey mist!
How utterly inconceivable!
Audrey took a deep breath, revealing an impeccable, polite smile, her voice laced with considerable apprehension as she inquired:
"Sir, has the trial concluded? May we return now?"

Alger Wilson, too, entertained a similar test, but his extensive experience rendered him more composed. He suppressed his impulse and remained silent, merely observing from the periphery.
Zhou Mingrui turned his gaze towards the inquirer. Through the blur, he could faintly discern the outline of the other party—a tall maiden with soft, honey-blonde hair—but her specific features remained indistinct.
He did not rush to answer the maiden's question. Instead, he turned his attention to the man seated beside her. His dark blue hair, wild as kelp, framed a medium-built figure that lacked substantial ruggedness.
In that very moment, Zhou Mingrui suddenly gained a measure of clarity. When he grew stronger, or when his understanding of this grey mist world deepened, perhaps he could truly penetrate the veiled obscurity, discern the true visages of the maiden and the man.
In this incident, they were the guests, and he, the host!
A shift in mindset allowed Zhou Mingrui to perceive details he had previously overlooked.
The voice of the sweet-voiced maiden and the steady, contained man alike felt ethereal, tinged with a faint crimson, as if projections of the two deep-red "Stars" upon the surface of the grey mist.
This projection stemmed from the connection between himself and the deep-red entity—an invisible yet palpable link.
If this connection were severed, the projection would dissipate, and they would return... Zhou Mingrui gave an almost imperceptible nod, his gaze fixed on the golden-haired maiden as he smiled softly:
"Certainly, if you formally request it, I can send you back now."

Finding no malice in the man's tone, Audrey breathed a sigh of relief. Trusting that a gentleman capable of such astonishing feats would undoubtedly uphold his word, she did not immediately press for departure. Instead, her emerald eyes darted left and right, a peculiar gleam igniting within them.
Her voice, a mixture of trepidation, anticipation, and eagerness, resonated as she spoke:
"This has been quite an extraordinary experience... Well, I have always anticipated something like this. I mean, I enjoy the mysterious, the miracles that surpass the natural order. No, my focus, I mean, Sir, what should I do to become a Beyonder?"

The more she spoke, the more exhilarated she became, even bordering on incoherence. The dreams that had germinated in her childhood, sparked by tales of the bizarre and supernatural recounted by her elders, seemed to finally hold the promise of fruition.
In the span of a few sentences, the earlier fear and panic had receded from her mind, replaced by curiosity and excitement.
Ask well! I also wonder about the answer... Zhou Mingrui internally chided himself.

He began to ponder how to respond in a manner that preserved an air of mystery and inscrutability.
Simultaneously, he felt that standing in conversation here felt rather mundane. In a scene like this, shouldn't there be a temple, a long table, and numerous armchairs carved with ancient patterns, steeped in an aura of mystery, upon which he would sit at the highest seat, silently gazing at his guests?

As soon as this thought crossed his mind, the grey mist surged violently, startling Audrey and Alger.
In the blink of an eye, they observed tall stone columns springing into existence around them, and above, a vast dome came into view.
The architecture was magnificent, grand, and imposing, as if it were the throne hall of legendary giants.
Beneath the central point of the dome, where the grey mist swirled, appeared a bronze long table, with ten high-backed chairs on either side, and similar seats positioned in front and behind. The backs of the chairs shimmered with a brilliance that defied reality, outlining strange constellations unseen in the mortal world.
Audrey and Alger found themselves seated opposite each other, occupying the positions closest to the head of the table.

The maiden glanced left, then right, unable to suppress a low mutter:
"What an astonishing sight..."
Indeed, it was astonishing... Zhou Mingrui extended his right hand, lightly tracing the edge of the bronze table—a motion so subtle it barely disturbed the surface.

Alger, too, took in the surroundings. After a few seconds of silence, he suddenly spoke, answering Audrey's question on behalf of Zhou Mingrui:
"You are a Runian, aren't you?"
"If you wish to become a Beyonder, join the Church of the Evernight Goddess, the Church of the Lord of Storms, or the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery."
"Though the vast majority of people may never encounter a supernatural being in their entire lives, even doubting the existence of the churches themselves, and within the major churches, many clergy share such doubts, I can unequivocally tell you that in the Tribunal, the Court of Judgment, and the execution agencies, Supernaturals still exist, still combating the dangers that grow in the darkness. However, their numbers are vastly reduced compared to the early Black Iron Age or before."

He listened intently, his body language betraying none of his focus. Drawing upon the historical knowledge left behind by Cai Lian, he understood that the "Black Iron Age" referred to the current era, the Fifth Era, beginning thirteen hundred forty-nine years ago.

Audrey listened quietly, then exhaled softly:
"Sir, I know what you're saying, even more than that—like the Nighthawks, the Mandated Punishers, the Machinery Hivemind. But, I am unwilling to lose my freedom."

Alger let out a low chuckle, speaking ambiguously:
"Is there no cost to becoming a Supernatural without considering joining a church, undergoing trials, or seeking out the Royal House, noble families with millennia of history, or perhaps stumbling upon hidden邪恶 organizations?"

Audrey instinctively puffed out her cheeks, then hastily glanced left and right, ensuring that the mysterious gentleman and the man opposite had not noticed her little gesture before pressing further:
"Is there no other way?"

Alger fell silent. After several breaths, he turned his head towards the silent, unresponsive "mysterious gentleman," Zhou Mingrui.
Observing that the other party offered no comment, he then turned back to Audrey, choosing his words carefully:
"I actually possess two Sequence 9 Potion recipes."

Sequence 9? Zhou Mingrui murmured to himself.
"Really? Which two?"

Audrey's eyes lit up with recognition. She clearly understood what Sequence 9 Potion recipes represented.
Alger leaned back slightly, his tone measured:
"As you know, for humans to become true Beyonders, they must rely on Potions. The names of these Potions derive from the 'profane stone tablet,' having undergone continuous translation through Goblin, Elven, Ancient Hermes, Ancient Feysac, and contemporary Hermes languages, evolving to align with the characteristics of each era. The name itself is not the key; the crucial factor is whether it embodies the 'core symbol' of the Potion."

"The Sequence 9 recipes I possess," Alger continued without pause, "one is called 'Mariner.' It grants you exceptional balance, allowing you to walk firmly on the deck even during a tempest. You will also gain remarkable strength and hidden scales beneath your skin, making you as slippery as a fish, difficult to grasp. In water, you will move with the agility of sea creatures, able to dive for at least ten minutes without any equipment."

"Sounds excellent... The 'Sea眷者' of the Lord of Storms?" Audrey asked, half in expectation, half in verification.

"In ancient times, it was indeed called 'Sea眷者,'" Alger replied without hesitation. "The second Sequence 9 recipe is called 'Audience.' As for what it was called in ancient times, I do not know. This Potion enhances your mental acuity and sharpens your observational skills. Having seen operas and plays, you can understand what 'Audience' signifies—it is like being a spectator, examining the 'actors' within the mundane world, discerning their true intentions through their expressions, their mannerisms, their speech quirks, and their unseen actions."

Here, Alger emphasized:
"You must remember, whether in lavish banquets or bustling streets, the audience is always merely an audience."

Audrey's eyes sparkled with excitement. It took her a while to speak:
"Why? Well, that's a follow-up question. I... I've grown fond of this feeling, 'Audience.' How can I obtain the recipe for 'Audience'? What can I offer in exchange?"

Alger, as if prepared for this, responded in a grave tone:
"One hundred milliliters of Ghost Shark blood."

Audrey nodded excitedly at first, then asked with concern:
"If I can acquire it—meaning, if I can—how should I give it to you? And how can I ensure that after you receive the Ghost Shark blood, you will provide me with the Potion recipe, and that it is genuine?"

Alger replied calmly:
"I will give you an address. Once I receive the Ghost Shark blood, I will send the recipe back to you, or inform you of it here directly."

"As for assurance," he continued, "I believe the presence of this mysterious gentleman will suffice to put both of us at ease."

Saying this, he directed his gaze towards Zhou Mingrui seated at the head of the table:
"Sir, you brought us here with your incomprehensible means, bestowing upon us powers beyond our wildest imaginations. Your testimony, whether from me or her, carries undeniable weight and cannot be disobeyed."

"Exactly!" Audrey exclaimed, her eyes shining with fervent agreement.
In her view, the mysterious gentleman whose methods defied comprehension was indeed a figure of sufficient "authority" to serve as a witness.
How could she, or the man opposite, dare to deceive him!

Half-turning her body, Audrey looked earnestly at Zhou Mingrui:
"Sir, please act as our witness for this transaction."

At that moment, she realized she had forgotten to ask a crucial question, one that lacked basic courtesy. Hastily, she inquired:
"Sir, how should we address you?"

Alger nodded slightly and followed suit, asking solemnly:
"Sir, how should we address you?"

Zhou Mingrui paused, a slight surprise flickering in his eyes. His fingers, resting on the bronze table, tapped rhythmically. Suddenly, the content of his previous divination flashed through his mind.
He leaned back, withdrawing his right hand and crossing his arms over his chest. A serene smile played upon his lips as he gazed at the two before him:
"You may call me..."

Pausing briefly, he continued, his tone gentle yet unassuming:
"The Fool."
