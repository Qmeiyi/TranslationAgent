**Chapter Title:** The Crimson Veil

**Content:**

Ouch!  
Oh, the pain! My head is splitting!

The dreams, filled with incoherent whispers, disintegrated in an instant. As Zhou Mingrui lay in slumber, his mind felt fragmented, as if struck by a blunt force, no, more like a sharp object piercing his temples, accompanied by a nauseating, unsettling stirring!

Hissing... groggily, Zhou Mingrui tried to turn, tried to clutch his throbbing temples, tried to sit up, but his limbs felt utterly unresponsive, as if his body had betrayed him.

It seems I am not fully awake yet, still lost in a dream... I’ve heard tales of those who mistake the edge of sleep for the peak of consciousness... Zhou Mingrui, no stranger to such occurrences, strained his will, desperate to break free from the shackles of darkness and illusion.

Yet, in this liminal state, his will felt as ethereal as mist, elusive and hard to grasp. Despite his efforts, his thoughts scattered, his mind clouded with stray thoughts.

What in the blazes? Why this sudden, agonizing headache in the dead of night?

Could it be... a cerebral hemorrhage? A stroke?  
Oh, blast it, am I about to meet my end prematurely?

Wake up! Wake up now!

Hmm, it seems the pain has lessened slightly? But my head feels as if a dull blade is slowly carving its way through...  
Enough of this. I cannot sleep anymore. How can I face the day?

Thinking of work... what good is work when I have this infernal headache? Of course, I’ll take the day off! No need to fear Boss Luo’s endless harangues!  
Aye, it’s not so bad, after all. A stolen half-day of respite!

Each jarring throb accumulated a phantom strength, until finally, Zhou Mingrui summoned his resolve, stiffened his spine, and opened his eyes, fully breaking free from the half-sleep.

His vision swam first, then blurred with a faint crimson hue. Focusing, he saw a plain wooden desk before him, a single notebook lying open in the center. The paper was rough and yellowed, the top page written in strange letters, the ink a deep, almost dripping black.

To the left of the notebook, near the desk edge, sat a neat stack of books, perhaps seven or eight volumes. To their right, the wall was adorned with grey-white pipes and a wall lamp connected to them—a fixture of Western classical design, roughly the size of a man’s head, with a transparent inner glass and a black metal grille surrounding it.

Below the lamp’s extinguished glow, a bottle of ink sat, its surface faintly aglow with a pale crimson light, the raised embossing forming indistinct angelic patterns.

Before the ink bottle, on the notebook’s right side, a sturdy, dark steel pen rested quietly, its tip shimmering with a soft light. Its cap lay beside a revolver, its barrel gleaming with a faint brass sheen.

A revolver? A six-shooter? Zhou Mingrui froze, utterly taken aback. The scene before him was utterly alien, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to his own room!

Disorientation and bewilderment washed over him as he noticed that the desk, the notebook, the ink bottle, even the revolver, seemed veiled in a thin, crimson "gauze"—a faint glow filtering in from outside.

Instinctively, he raised his head, letting his gaze slowly ascend:
In the air above, a dark "velvet curtain" stretched out, upon which hung a blood-red, full moon, serene and radiating.

This... Zhou Mingrui felt an inexplicable dread. He sprang to his feet, but before his legs could fully extend, another sharp pain seized him, stealing his strength, causing his center of gravity to falter. His backside slammed hard against the hard wood of the chair.

*Thump!*

The impact did little more than jolt him. Gripping the desk, Zhou Mingrui pushed himself upright, turning frantically to take in his surroundings.

The room was small, with doors on either side, and a wooden bunk bed pressed against the wall opposite. Between the left door and the bunk lay a cabinet with an upper shelf and five drawers below. At chest height on the left wall, another set of grey-white pipes ran, terminating in a peculiar mechanical contraption, its gears and bearings partially exposed.

Near the desk, a wooden corner held a coal stove and various kitchen utensils—pots, pans. Beyond the right door lay a cracked穿衣镜 (mirror), its wooden base simple and unadorned.

Glancing around, Zhou Mingrui caught sight of himself in the mirror—a figure of medium build, black hair, brown eyes, wearing a flaxen shirt, thin and with average features but deeper contours...

This... Zhou Mingrui let out a sharp inhale, his heart filled with a sense of utter helplessness and disarray. The revolver, the Western classical furnishings, and that crimson moon unlike any on Earth—all pointed to something profound.

Am I... have I crossed over? Zhou Mingrui’s mouth gaped slightly.

He’d grown up reading online fiction, often fantasizing about such scenarios, but the reality was a shock, leaving him momentarily unable to process.

Seconds later, a pang of bitterness twisted his lips—he mused self-deprecatingly, like the story of Yu Gong who admired dragons but was afraid of them.

Had the persistent pain kept his mind sharp, he might have doubted that this was merely a dream.

Calm down, calm down... Taking deep breaths, Zhou Mingrui fought to quell the rising panic.

Just then, as his mind and body settled, fragments of memory surged into his consciousness, presenting themselves slowly, one by one!

Zhou Mingrui. Born in Tingen City, Awwa County, Loen Kingdom, a recent graduate of Khoy University’s history department...

His father, a Royal Army sergeant, had died in a colonial conflict on the southern continent, his pension allowing Zhou Mingrui entry into a private grammar school, laying the foundation for university...

His mother, a devout follower of The Evernight Goddess, passed away the year he passed the Khoy University entrance exam...

He had an older brother and a younger sister, living together in a two-bedroom apartment...

The family was not wealthy, bordering on poverty, solely sustained by his brother’s job as a clerk in an import-export company...

As a history graduate, Zhou Mingrui possessed Ancient Feysac, the purported ancestor of all northern continent scripts, and Hermes, the ancient language often found in tombs, linked to sacrifice and prayer...

Hermes? Zhou Mingrui’s heart skipped a beat. He pressed his aching temple, his gaze fixed on the notebook. The strange letters on the yellowed paper began to shift, from alien to familiar, from familiar to decipherable.

This is written in Hermes!

The deep, almost dripping ink declared:

*“All mortals must die, including me.”*

Ssssh! Zhou Mingrui felt an inexplicable terror, instinctively recoiling, trying to distance himself from the notebook and those words.

He felt weak, nearly collapsing. He grabbed the desk edge, his trembling limbs steadying. The air around him seemed agitated, whispers faint yet pervasive in his ears, like childhood tales spun by elders to frighten children.

Shaking his head, he realized it was all a hallucination. He steadied himself, his breathing heavy, and tore his gaze from the notebook.

His eyes then fell upon the revolver, its brass gleam catching the light. A question suddenly struck him.

*“With Zhou Mingrui’s financial situation, how could he afford a revolver?”* Zhou Mingrui frowned.

Lost in thought, he noticed a half-fingerprint of blood on the desk’s edge, its colour darker than the moonlight, thicker than the gauze.

A bloodstain!

*“Bloodstain?”* Zhou Mingrui instinctively flipped open his right hand, peering down. His palm and fingers were smeared with blood.

Simultaneously, the headache returned, slightly lessened but persistent.

*“Did I hit my head?”* Zhou Mingrui wondered, turning his body towards the cracked mirror.

After a few steps, his reflection—a man of medium height, black hair, brown eyes, bearing the unmistakable air of study—came into clear view.

This... is me now, Zhou Mingrui?

Zhou Mingrui froze. The lighting was poor from the crimson moonlight, making it hard to discern. He stepped closer, almost colliding with the mirror.

Using the faint, gauzy moonlight, he tilted his head to inspect his temple.

The mirror, clear as a bell, showed a狰狞 (monstrous) wound nestled against his temple, its edges scorched, surrounded by blood.

Okay, here is the revised English translation with corrected terminology, focusing on the specific issue raised and ensuring consistency for the mentioned terms:

**Chapter 2: Situation**

**Chunk 1**

*Thump-thump-thump!*

Zhou Mingrui recoiled, staggering back several steps. The sight before him was so shocking that it seemed the reflection in the **穿衣镜** (clothing mirror) wasn't of himself, but of a dried-up corpse.

A person with such grievous wounds could not possibly be alive!

Disbelieving, he tilted his head again, checking the other side, even though the distance increased and the image blurred. Yet, even with the diminished clarity, the **贯穿** wounds and the crimson bloodstains remained undeniable.

"Th…"
Taking a deep breath, Zhou Mingrui forced himself to calm down.
He reached out and pressed his hand firmly against his left chest, feeling the heart beneath leap and throb, strong and vigorous.
Then he touched the skin exposed by his shirt, feeling a faint coolness beneath which flowed a warmth.
Squatting down, he tested the flexibility of his knee before standing up again. The frantic edge had lessened.
"What in the name of—?" He frowned, whispering to himself, intending to examine the head wound more thoroughly.
Taking two steps forward, he paused abruptly. The light from the blood moon outside seemed too dim, insufficient for a proper inspection.

A fragment of memory surged unexpectedly. Zhou Mingrui turned his head towards the wall beside his desk, where a gas lamp was enclosed within a frame of grey pipes and metal grilles.
This was the current standard gaslight, its flame steady, its illumination excellent.
Considering the circumstances of his predecessor, **克莱恩·莫雷蒂** (Celenne Morty), acquiring even a kerosene lamp would have been stretching the truth; candles were the expected fare for someone of his station. Yet, four years prior, while **克莱恩·莫雷蒂** (Celenne Morty) had studied late into the night, preparing for the Khoy University entrance examinations, his brother, **班森** (Benson), believing it crucial for the family's future, had insisted on providing the necessary conditions, even borrowing money.
Of course, **班森** (Benson), literate and working for several years, was far from reckless, lacking in guile, or failing to consider the consequences. He had persuaded the landlord, Mr. French, to undertake the basic pipe installation by arguing that "installing gas pipes would enhance the apartment's prestige and aid in future rentals." And himself, leveraging his employment with an import/export company, had secured nearly cost-price gas lamps. In the end, he had managed it all with his savings alone, without borrowing from anyone.

The memory fragment flickered past. Zhou Mingrui returned to his desk, opening the valve on the pipe, then flicking the gas lamp switch.
*Click-click-click,* the friction-igniting mechanism clicked several times, but the expected light did not manifest as he had anticipated.
*Click-click-click!* He flicked the switch again, but the gaslight remained stubbornly dim.

"Hmm…" Shrinking his hand back, he pressed his left temple, drawing upon the fragmented memories to seek a cause.
Seconds later, he turned his body and walked towards the door, heading for the identical mechanical contraption mounted on the wall next to it, connected by the same grey pipes.
It was the **瓦斯计费器** (gas meter)!

Glancing at the exposed gears and bearings, Zhou Mingrui reached into his trouser pocket.
The coin he pulled out was a dull yellow, gleaming with copper lustre. The obverse bore the portrait of a man wearing a crown, the reverse featured wheat ears crowning the number "1".

Zhou Mingrui knew this was the most basic currency of the **鲁恩王国** (Loen Kingdom), called a **便士** (Penny). A Penny's purchasing power was roughly equivalent to three or four yuan before his arrival. There were also **半便士** (halfpennies) and **四分之一便士** (farthings), but they were still coarse denominations, often necessitating rounding up for everyday transactions.
After letting the George III penny he held rotate several times in his fingers, he rubbed it and inserted it into the vertical, slit-like "mouth" of the gas meter.

*Jingle-jangle!*
As the penny fell into the meter's interior, the sound of creaking gears immediately followed, playing a short, melodious mechanical tune.

He gazed for a few seconds, then returned to his desk, reaching out to flick the gas lamp switch again.
*Click-click-click, thump!*
A flame sprang up, rapidly growing larger. The bright light first filled the lamp globe, then spilled through the clear glass, bathing the room in a warm, almost inviting glow.

Darkness recoiled sharply. Crimson relinquished its hold on the window. Zhou Mingrui felt an inexplicable sense of reassurance wash over him. He hurried to the **穿衣镜** (clothing mirror).
This time, he scrutinized his temple meticulously, not missing a single detail.
After careful comparison, he found that aside from the initial bloodstains, the horrifying wound showed no further signs of bleeding. It seemed blessed with excellent **止血** (haemostasis) and bandaging. And the sluggish, creeping grey matter of the brain, coupled with the visibly knitting flesh of the wound, signalled the approach of healing. Perhaps in thirty or forty minutes, maybe two or three hours, only a faint mark would remain.

"Curative effects from the transition?" Zhou Mingrui quirked the corner of his right mouth, whispering silently.
He took a long, slow breath. Regardless of the cause, at least he was still very much alive!
Centering himself, he pulled out a small block of soap, took a worn towel hanging beside the cabinet, and selected one of them. Then, he opened the door and headed towards the second-floor common washroom for tenants.

Hmm, the bloodstains on his head needed attending to. He couldn't afford to look like a crime scene at every glance. It was bad enough if it scared himself, but if it frightened Melissa tomorrow morning, when she had to get up early for work, that would be a disaster indeed!
The hallway outside was pitch black, only the faint, crimson moonlight filtering through the window at the far end barely outlining the shapes protruding from the darkness, making them resemble countless monstrous eyes silently observing the living.
Zhou Mingrui lightened his footsteps, moving with a nervous tension towards the washroom.

Once inside, the moonlight was stronger, illuminating everything clearly. He stood before the sink and turned on the tap.
*Faucet water sound,* the noise entered his ears, and suddenly he recalled Mr. French, the landlord.
As water rates were included in the rent, the short, stout, thin man, perpetually wearing his top hat, waistcoat, and black formal coat, often bustled by to inspect the washrooms, listening intently for the sound of running water.
If the noise was particularly loud, Mr. French would disregard his gentlemanly decorum, furiously brandishing his walking stick, pounding on the washroom door, and shouting, "Damn thieves!" "Waste is a sin!" "I'll remember this!" "Let me catch you doing it again, and you can pack your dirty bags and get out!" "Believe me, this is the most reasonably priced apartment in Tingen City. You won't find a more generous landlord than me!"

Shaking his head clear, Zhou Mingrui wet the towel and began washing the bloodstains from his face, repeating the action several times.
After checking himself in the dilapidated washroom mirror, confirming that only the **狰狞伤口** (horrifying wound) and pale face remained, Zhou Mingrui felt a significant weight lift from his shoulders. He then removed his linen shirt and used the soap to scrub the bloodstains from his torso.
Just then, his brow furrowed. A new worry occurred to him:
The injuries were dramatic, the blood abundant. Besides himself, the room itself must be stained!
After a few minutes, Zhou Mingrui had cleaned his shirt. Holding the damp towel, he hurried back home. First, he wiped the bloodstains from his hands on the desk. Then, relying on the gas lamp's light, he searched for other traces.
His search yielded results almost immediately. There were numerous splatter stains on the floor and under the desk. And, on the left wall, near the floor, lay a single, bright yellow bullet casing.

"...Shot himself in the temple with a revolver?" The disparate clues suddenly connected in his mind. Zhou Mingrui guessed the cause of **克莱恩·莫雷蒂** (Celenne Morty)'s death.
He didn't rush to verify this immediately. First, he meticulously cleaned the bloodstains, tidied up the "scene," before picking up the casing and returning to his desk. He opened the revolver's cylinder and ejected the cartridges within.
*Clickety-clack,* five bullets and one empty casing lay there, gleaming with brass.

"Indeed…" Zhou Mingrui glanced at the empty casing, nodding slightly as he carefully reloaded each bullet into the cylinder.
His gaze shifted left, falling upon the open notebook where the words "All men must die, including me" were written. More questions churned within him.
Where did the gun come from?
Suicide, or a staged suicide?
What could have befallen a history graduate from a **平民** (commoner) family?
How did this method of suicide leave so little blood? Was it because his timely transition granted him some inherent **治愈** (healing)?
He pondered for a moment, then changed into another linen shirt and sat down in the chair, contemplating the truly crucial matters.
**克莱恩·莫雷蒂** (Celenne Morty)'s situation, while unfortunate, wasn't his primary concern. The real question was figuring out *why* he had transitioned and whether he could return!

Parents, relatives, friends, the lively online world, the variety of delicious food... These were all things he desperately wished to reclaim!
*Click, click, click...* Zhou Mingrui's right hand absently spun the revolver cylinder, then snapped it shut, repeating the action.
"Hmm, things haven't been drastically different from usual, just... unlucky. How could I suddenly transition without any warning?"
"Bad luck... Wait a minute, I performed a **转运仪式** (luck charm) before dinner tonight!"
A bolt of lightning flashed through his mind, illuminating the foggy memories obscured by the transition.
As a self-proclaimed "jack of all trades" in keyboard politics, history, economics, biology, and folklore, he was often derided by his friends as "a master of only a little bit of everything."
And among these "trades," **方术** (occult arts) were included.
Last year, returning to his hometown, he'd found an old, bound, vertical edition "**秦汉秘传方术纪要**" (**Treatise on Secret Transmission of Formulas and Techniques from the Qin and Han Dynasties**). Finding it intriguing, thinking it might help him "win arguments" online, he'd bought it. Unfortunately, his interest had faded quickly; the vertical script was difficult to read, and he'd only flipped through the beginning before shelving the book in the corner.
Now, after a string of misfortunes in the past month – losing his phone, a client backing out, a work error – he'd randomly remembered the luck charm mentioned at the start of the **方术纪要** (Treatise on Secret Transmission of Formulas and Techniques). It required nothing more than simple materials.
With nothing to lose, he retrieved the book, followed the instructions, and performed the ritual before his dinner. But nothing happened then.
Until the middle of the night, when he had transitioned!
He *had* transitioned!
"It's a definite possibility that the luck charm was responsible... Hmm, I'll try performing it here tomorrow. If it was indeed the cause, then perhaps there's a way back!" Zhou Mingrui stopped spinning the revolver, sitting up straight.
He had to try, no matter what. Even a dead horse is worth riding for a chance at a cure!

**Chapter 3: Melissa**

With the plan firmly established, Zhou Mingrui felt a newfound sense of purpose, the fear, hesitation, and unease receding into the corners of his mind. Only at this moment did he find the leisure to meticulously examine the fragmented memories left by Clarence.

Habitually, he rose, closed the pipeline valve, watched the wall lamp fade slowly until it extinguished, and then sank back into his seat. Absently stroking the brass cylinder of the revolver, he pressed his temple and quietly "relished" the crimson-lit darkness, much like the most attentive audience in a cinema.

Possibly influenced by the bullet wound, Clarence's memories were akin to shattered glass, not only lacking coherence but also missing significant portions. For instance, the origins of the finely crafted revolvers, whether the act was suicide or murder, and the meaning behind the notebook's inscription, "All will die, including me," remained elusive. Doubts also lingered about his involvement in peculiar events two days prior.

Not only were specific recollections fragmented, but even acquired knowledge seemed incomplete. In his current state, Zhou Mingrui believed Clarence would likely flunk out of university if he were to return, despite having only been away from campus for a few days and maintaining no leniency towards himself.

_"Two days hence, I must attend the history department interview at Ting Technical School..."_

_"The Loen Kingdom has a tradition of not retaining graduates directly in academia... Father provided letters of recommendation, one for Ting Technical School and one for Backlund University..."_

...

Lost in this silent contemplation, the red moon outside the window began to dip towards the western horizon, gradually sinking lower until the first faint light of dawn appeared on the eastern horizon, painting the horizon in hues of gold. Just then, a stir came from the inner room, quickly followed by footsteps approaching the partition door.

_"Melissa is awake... She's as punctual as ever." Zhou Mingrui offered a faint smile, influenced by Clarence's memories, seeing Melissa much like his own younger sister._

_"But I have no actual younger sister..."_ he mentally retorted.

Melissa was unlike Clarence or Benson; her foundational education was not completed at the Sunday School of the Evernight Goddess Church. By the time she reached school age, the Kingdom of Loen had enacted the Elementary Education Act, establishing a low-to-middle educational committee with dedicated funding to increase accessibility. Within three years, following the integration of numerous church-affiliated schools, a multitude of public elementary schools emerged, strictly adhering to the principle of religious neutrality, avoiding entanglements with the disputes of the Lord of Storms, the Evernight Goddess, and the God of Steam and Machinery churches.

Compared to the Sunday Schools, which cost a mere penny per week, the weekly three-penny tuition for public elementary schools seemed exorbitant. However, the former only operated once a week, while the latter required six full days of schooling, making the latter's cost more justifiable despite its higher price.

Melissa, unlike most girls, harboured a fascination for gears, springs, and bearings, aspiring to become a master of steam mechanics. Compensating for her earlier educational shortcomings and acutely aware of the importance of learning, her elder brother Benson, who had supported Clarence's university education, now nurtured his sister's dreams. After all, the Ting Technical School represented only secondary education, negating the need for further accumulation through grammar schools or public schools.

Last July, at fifteen years old, Melissa passed the entrance examination and, as desired, became a student in the Steam and Mechanics department at the Ting Technical School, with her weekly tuition increasing to nine pennies. Simultaneously, due to the impact of the Southland situation, the company Benson worked for suffered a significant decline in both profits and business volume, necessitating a workforce reduction exceeding one-third. To secure his job and sustain his livelihood, Benson could only accept heavier tasks, often requiring overtime or assignments to harsh environments, much like these recent days.

Clarence had contemplated alleviating his brother's burden but felt acutely aware of his own deficiencies as a commoner with only a basic grammar school education. For instance, Old Fasak, the foundational language of all North大陸 nations, was a subject taught from childhood to noble heirs and wealthy children, whereas he encountered it for the first time only during university. Similar shortcomings were numerous, and Clarence, pushing himself relentlessly, often staying up late and rising early, barely managed to keep pace, graduating with mediocre grades.

The memories of his brother and sister flickered in Zhou Mingrui's mind, until the door to the inner room creaked open, snapping him back to reality. He remembered the revolver still resting in his grasp—a semi-controlled item! It could frighten a child! And what about his own head wound!

As Melissa stepped through the doorway, Zhou Mingrui hastily pressed his temple, frantically pulling out the desk drawer and tossing the revolver inside with a resounding *thud*.

_"What’s wrong?" Melissa asked, her gaze filled with curiosity._

Though lean and pale due to inadequate nutrition, her youthful face still retained a luster that radiated the essence of a maiden. Meeting her hazel eyes fixed upon him, Zhou Mingrui forced composure, picking up nearby objects, then smoothly closing the drawer to conceal the revolver. The sensation of his hand on his temple confirmed the wound had healed.

From the drawer, he retrieved a silver-white pocket watch adorned with vine and leaf patterns. A simple press at the crown opened the cover. It was the most valuable item left by their father, a Royal Army Sergeant, though its second-hand nature meant it was perpetually temperamental, even after repeated repairs by watchmakers, causing Benson, who cherished it to elevate his status, frequent embarrassment. It was conveniently left behind at home.

One couldn't help but admire Melissa's potential mechanical aptitude. Having grasped the theoretical knowledge, she began experimenting with the tools from the technical school, recently claiming she had successfully repaired the watch!

Observing the cover open, Zhou Mingrui noted the second hand was momentarily stuck. He tried winding the crown, but no click indicated the mainspring was taut, and the second hand remained motionless.

_"Seems like it broke again,"_ he mumbled, looking at his sister.

Melissa glanced at him without expression, quickly approaching and snatching the watch.

Standing still, she first pulled up the crown button, turning it only a few clicks before the rhythmic ticking of the second hand resumed.

Normally, pulling the crown should adjust the time... Zhou Mingrui's expression froze in bewilderment.

At that moment, the distant cathedral bell tolled six times, its sound resonant and ethereal.

Melissa listened intently, then pushed the crown further up, twisting it repeatedly to set the time.

_"Done,"_ she stated succinctly, devoid of any inflection, before snapping the cover shut and handing the watch back to Zhou Mingrui.

Zhou Mingrui offered a strained but polite smile.

Melissa cast one last look at her brother, turned, and walked towards the cabinet, retrieving her toothbrush, towel, and other essentials before pulling the door open and heading to the shared bathroom.

_"That expression earlier... was it a mix of annoyance and resignation?"_

_"The look of pity towards a mentally challenged sibling?"_

Zhou Mingrui shook his head, chuckling to himself, snapped the watch cover shut with a *click*, then opened it again.

Repeating this mechanical action, his thoughts wandered to a question.

Without a silencer, Clarence's supposed suicide, yes, let's call it suicide for now, must have been quite loud. Yet, Melissa, living only a wall away, hadn't noticed a thing.

Was she too deeply asleep? Or was the act of suicide itself inherently strange?

*Click*, open. *Snap*, close. As Melissa returned from her wash, she witnessed her brother's unconscious ritual of opening and closing the watch cover.

Her gaze once again clouded with resignation, her voice sweet as she said, *"Clarence, take out the remaining bread. Remember to buy fresh ones today. And the meat and peas. You're heading to the interview soon; I'll make you pea stew with lamb."*

As she spoke, she pulled the stove from the corner, fanned the embers to light a kettle of water. Just before it boiled, she opened the lower cabinet drawer, carefully taking out a canister of inferior tea leaves, adding about a dozen to the pot, pretending it were genuine tea.

Pouring two generous cups, Melissa and Zhou Mingrui shared two black rye loaves with the tea. Lacking wood屑 and excessive麸质, yet still unpalatable... Zhou Mingrui, weakened and hungry, forced himself to swallow the bread despite its poor quality, aided by the tea.

A few minutes later, Melissa finished, tidied her black hair, and looked at Zhou Mingrui.

_"Remember to buy new bread, just eight pounds. It's hot; too much will spoil. Also, the lamb and peas. Don’t forget!"_

Indeed, caring for a bookish brother, even to the point of repetition... Zhou Mingrui smiled and nodded.

_"I will."_

Considering the Loen Kingdom's pound, Zhou Mingrui estimated it roughly equated to half a kilogram, akin to his familiar 'jin'.

Melissa said no more, prepared her lunch from the remaining bread, donned her late mother's worn-out veil, and took her own knapsack, sewn by herself, containing her books and stationery, ready to leave.

Today was not Sunday; she had to attend school for the entire day. The walk from their apartment to Ting Technical School took approximately fifty minutes, but public horse-drawn carriages offered transportation at a rate of one penny per kilometer, with a city limit of four pennies and six pennies for the suburbs. Melissa, ever thrifty, always chose to walk the distance.

Just as she opened the door, she paused, half-turning.

_"Clarence, no need to buy too much lamb and peas. Benson might not be back until Sunday. And yes, just eight pounds of bread."_

_"Alright, alright,"_ Zhou Mingrui replied helplessly.

Simultaneously, he silently repeated the word "Sunday" several times.

In the North大陸, the year was divided into twelve months, ranging from 365 to 366 days, and the week consistently consisted of seven days.

Astronomy suggested this was a parallel world, while religion confirmed the North大陸 recognized seven principal deities: the Eternal Sun, the Lord of Storms, the God of Knowledge and Wisdom, the Evernight Goddess, the Earth Mother, the God of War, and the God of Steam and Machinery.

Watching his sister close the door and leave, Zhou Mingrui let out a sigh, quickly shifting his focus to the divination ritual.

_"Sorry, I truly wish to return home..."*

**Chapter Title:** The 4th Chapter Divination

**English Draft:**

Re-seating himself, Zhou Mingrui waited until the distant church bell tolled seven times, the echoes fading slowly, before he rose leisurely and moved towards the cabinet, retrieving his attire.

A black tailcoat, trousers cinching slightly at the ankles, and a low-crowned top hat completed the ensemble, lending him the semblance of Victorian drama. Gazing into the mirror, he saw not merely a reflection, but a stagehand preparing for a scene.

"A mere errand, nothing more... just procuring materials for a... divination ritual," he muttered softly, shaking his head with a wry smile. "Clayen was so preoccupied with the impending interview that even his body adopted this habit, this sole respectable attire, whenever his focus wavered."

Exhaling, he removed the tailcoat and waistcoat, replacing them with an aged, tawny-colored overcoat and a matching felt top hat with a round brim. Adjusting himself, he approached the bunk bed, lifted the mattress, and reached through a discreet tear in the base, fingers probing until he found the hidden compartment.

His right hand withdrew clutching a roll of banknotes, roughly seven bills, their color a deep, almost translucent emerald green.

This was Benson's entire savings, the funds covering his sustenance for these three days. Only two five-Soli notes remained; the rest were one-Soli bills.

Within the monetary hierarchy of the Loen Kingdom, the Soli ranked second, originating from ancient silver coins, with twelve Pennies to a Soli. Denominations included the One-Soli and the Five-Soli notes.

At the apex sat the Gold Pound, a paper currency backed by gold, directly convertible. One Gold Pound equated to twenty Soli, available in One, Five, and Ten denominations.

Unfurling the notes, a faint, peculiar scent of ink permeated the air—a scent tinged with the very essence of currency.

Perhaps it was the lingering influence of Clayen’s fragmented memories, or perhaps it was the unchanging, deep-seated desire for wealth within himself, but in that moment, Zhou Mingrui found himself inexplicably enamored with these little notes.

Look, the designs were exquisite, rendering the dour King George III, with his waxed handlebar mustache, almost endearing... Look, the watermark visible through the sunlight was tantalizing, the meticulously crafted anti-counterfeiting tags distinguishing it from its fraudulent counterparts with an undeniable grace!

He admired the notes for nearly half a minute, then extracted two One-Soli bills, rolling the remainder back up and returning them to the hidden pocket within the mattress.

Tidying the torn fabric around the hole, he neatly folded the two One-Soli notes and slipped them into the left breast pocket of his tawny overcoat, separating them from the Pennies tucked into his trouser pockets.

Pocketed the keys in his right pocket and slinging the deep brown paper bag over his shoulder, he strode towards the door.

Thump-thump, his footsteps quickened then slowed, finally ceasing.

Zhou Mingrui stood by the door, his brow furrowed unknowingly.

The unresolved mysteries surrounding Clayen’s suicide—would venturing out now invite some unforeseen "misfortune"?

After a moment’s contemplation, he returned to the desk, pulled open a drawer, and retrieved the brass revolver, its gleaming surface a stark contrast to the shadows.

This was the only weapon he could think of, yet a potent one! Though he had never fired a shot in anger, merely drawing this pistol should suffice to intimidate.

Running his fingers over the cold metal cylinder, he stuffed the revolver into the pocket containing the banknotes, clenching the notes in his palm and pressing the grip firmly against his leg, concealing the gesture.

A sense of security bloomed within him, yet a nagging doubt surfaced:

"Won't it discharge accidentally?"

Ruminating, he quickly devised a solution. Drawing the pistol, he flicked the cylinder to the left, ensuring the chamber left vacant by Clayen’s "suicide" was now aligned for safety, then snapped it shut with a decisive click.

Thus, any misfire would be inert, utterly harmless.

Re-pocketing the revolver, his left hand remained embedded in the coat, no longer free.

He adjusted his cap with his right hand and pushed open the door, stepping out with a resolute stride.

The corridor remained dimly lit even at midday, sunlight filtering through the end windows meagerly. Descending the stairs and stepping out of the apartment, he finally embraced the warmth and brightness.

Though July approached, heralding summer, the climate in Tingren, a northern city of the Loen Kingdom, possessed unique characteristics. Even the highest recorded temperatures on this world rarely exceeded thirty degrees Celsius, a mere ninety degrees Fahrenheit. The morning air was cool, yet the streets bore signs of neglect—puddles mingled with litter, a common sight in Clayen’s memory, even in areas with sewers, owing to the sheer density and poverty of the inhabitants.

"Try our delicious pan-fried meat and fish!" a流动摊贩 cried out.

"Fresh oysters, steaming hot, for just five Pennies a bowl in the morning!"

"Crispy little buns, Mackerel soup with Cider Beer!"

"Seashells, seashells, fresh from the tide!"

"Fresh vegetables from the countryside farms, cheap and delicious!"

...

Vegetable sellers, fruit vendors, and food stalls hawked their wares, their voices a cacophony amidst the hurried pedestrians. Some paused, deliberating their choices; others grew impatient, waving them off, work yet to be secured today.

Zhou Mingrui navigated the chaotic street, his left hand gripping the revolver tightly, clutching the banknotes in his palm, his right hand steadying the felt hat, head slightly bowed, eyes scanning the ground as he weaved through the crowd.

Crowded places bred thieves, especially in this district teeming with semi-employed laborers and hungry, exploited children.

As the crowd thinned, he straightened his posture, raised his head, and surveyed the street ahead.

A street musician played his hurdy-gurdy nearby, the melody both melancholic and spirited.

Beside him, ragged children, their faces蜡黄 from malnutrition, swayed to the rhythm, their bodies instinctively twisting in a self-invented dance, their faces alight with joy, as if they were little princes or angels.

A woman with a dour visage passed by, her skirt soiled, skin dull. Her eyes were vacant, yet a flicker of recognition sparked when she glanced at the children, perhaps seeing a shadow of her own thirty years prior.

Zhou Mingrui passed her, turning down another street, stopping before "Slin's Bakery."

The owner, Mrs. Wendyslin, a septuagenarian with entirely gray hair, always wore a gentle smile. Since Clayen’s earliest memories, she had been selling bread and pastries here.

Hmm, her Tingren biscuits and lemon cakes were simply divine... Zhou Mingrui swallowed, smiling.

"Mrs. Slin, please, sixteen Black Rye loaves."

"Oh, little Clayen, where’s Benson? Not back yet?" Mrs. Slin asked, her eyes crinkling with amusement.

"Still a few days," Zhou Mingrui answered vaguely.

Mrs. Slin, meanwhile, was portioning out the bread, her tone tinged with nostalgia.

"He’s such a diligent lad, he’ll find a good wife yet." A playful curve touched her lips.

"Now it’s you, you’ve graduated. Our esteemed History graduate from Khoy University~ You’ll soon be earning your keep. You shouldn’t live in such a run-down apartment; at the very least, you need your own washroom."

"Mrs. Slin, you look remarkably young and vibrant today," Zhou Mingrui managed a nervous chuckle.

If Clayen secured the position as a Lecturer at Tingren University, their family’s fortunes would indeed improve! In his fragmented memories, he had even fantasized about renting a standalone house in the suburbs, complete with five or six rooms upstairs, two washrooms, a large balcony, two rooms downstairs, a dining room, a living room, a kitchen, another washroom, and a basement storage.

Not an impossible dream; even an intern Lecturer at Tingren University earned a weekly salary of two Gold Pounds, rising to three Gold Pounds and ten Soli upon confirmation. Knowing that his brother, Benson, with years of service, earned a mere one Pound and ten Soli weekly, while factory laborers often scraped by on less than one Pound, Zhou Mingrui calculated the cost of such a house, ranging from nineteen Soli to one Pound and eighteen Soli per month in rent.

"It’s the difference between earning three thousand Soli monthly and fourteen thousand five hundred..." he mused under his breath.

Yet, all this hinged on passing the interview at either Tingren or Backlund University.

Other avenues? Without connections, one couldn't secure a Pathway into public service, and historians faced even narrower job prospects, with private advisors for nobles or industrial magnates being a rare commodity.

Considering that Clayen’s knowledge was fragmented, incomplete, riddled with gaps, Zhou Mingrui felt a wave of awkwardness and unease regarding Mrs. Slin’s hopeful words.

"No, I’ve always been young at heart," Mrs. Slin quipped, handing him the measured sixteen Black Rye loaves in his own brown paper bag.

"Nine Pennies," she held out her right hand.

Each loaf weighed approximately half a Pound, with inevitable variance.

"Nine Pennies? That’s less than the two days ago, wasn't it eleven?" Zhou Mingrui asked reflexively.

And just last month, it was fifteen Pennies.

"The repeal of the 'Grain Act' and the demonstrations thanking those who protested," Mrs. Slin gestured expansively with both hands, a knowing smile playing on her lips.

Zhou Mingrui nodded vaguely, his memories of the 'Grain Act' fragmented, recalling only that its core was protecting domestic agricultural prices, preventing the import of grain from southern nations like Fenwport, Masque, and Luxembourg until prices reached a certain threshold.

Why would people protest such a measure?

He didn't dwell on it, mindful of the revolver in his pocket. Carefully extracting banknotes, he produced a One-Soli bill and offered it to Mrs. Slin.

Receiving three Pennies in change, he slipped them into his trouser pocket before heading towards the "Lettuce and Meat Market" down the street, endeavoring to fulfill his sister Melissa’s request for lamb stew with tender peas.

At the junction of Iron Cross Street and the Crocuses Street lay the Town Square, now bustling with activity as numerous tents had been erected. A bizarrely dressed clown, distributing pamphlets, caught his eye.

"Tomorrow evening, Circus performance?" Zhou Mingrui glanced at the pamphlet, whispering its contents.

Melissa would adore it. What was the cost of admission? The thought crossed his mind as he approached.

He was about to inquire of the clown in his red-and-yellow attire when a raspy female voice spoke from his side:

"Desire divination?"

Twisting his head instinctively, Zhou Mingrui saw a woman standing before a low tent, her head covered by a pointed hat, dressed in a black gown, her face daubed with red and yellow theatrical makeup, her eyes a deep, grayish-blue.

"No," he shook his head, lacking the means for such frivolity.

The woman smiled enigmatically.

"My Tarot divination is remarkably accurate."

"Tarot..." Zhou Mingrui froze.

The pronunciation bore a striking resemblance to the Tarot cards from his own world!

And in his world, Tarot was a form of fortune-telling using playing cards, augmented with symbolic 'picture cards'.

Wait... a sudden recollection struck him. The origin of Tarot divination in this world was not from the Seven orthodox deities, nor ancient relics, but was invented over one hundred seventy years prior by Rosier Gustav, then the Head of State of the Intish Republic.

This Rosier gentleman had invented the steam engine, improved sailing ships, overthrown the Intish Kingdom's monarchy, and gained the recognition of the 'God of Artisans' church, becoming the first Head of State of the new republic.

He went on to conquer territories, incorporating nations like Luxembourg into the Intish sphere, compelling powers like the Loen Kingdom, Fenwport, and Fasack Empire to submit. He later reorganized the republic into an empire, styling himself 'Caesar'.

It was during Rosier's reign that the church received its first public Revelation since the Fifth Century, leading to the title 'God of Steam and Machinery'. Rosier also invented Tarot divination, establishing the current composition and gameplay of the cards, including familiar games like Whist, Patience, Texas Hold'em, and Quart...

Furthermore, he dispatched fleets to discover routes to the southern continent through storms and chaotic currents, initiating the era of colonization.

Alas, his later years were marred by betrayal, culminating in his assassination by the Eternal Sun Church, the Solon family (the ruling dynasty of Intish), and other nobles in the year 1198 of the Fifth Century, dying in the White Maple Palace.

This recollection brought a peculiar ache to Zhou Mingrui’s teeth.

Could this woman be a fellow traveler from another world?

With this thought, he resolved to examine the Tarot cards here. He nodded towards the woman, the one with the painted face.

"If the price is reasonable, I shall give it a try," he said, his voice hesitant.

The woman beamed, "Sir, you are the first visitor today. It shall be free."

**Chapter Title:** Chapter 5: The Ritual

**Original Content:**

Free? Free things are the most expensive! Zhou Mingrui muttered silently, determined to reject any additional services that might come up later.
Brave enough to divine that I’m a **traveller from another world**? (Translator’s Note: “穿越者” refers to someone who has “crossed over,” typically meaning someone who has traveled through time or space, often used for characters who have been transported to another world.)
He followed the woman with red and yellow face paint, bending down and entering the low tent.
The interior of the tent was extremely dark, with only a dim and scarce light filtering in, barely illuminating a table covered in tarot cards.
The woman, wearing a pointed hat, was completely unfazed. Her black skirt flowed like water around the table, and she sat opposite him, lighting a candle.
The candlelight flickered and cast a dim, uncertain glow throughout the tent, instantly adding a sense of mystery.
Zhou Mingrui sat down without a sound, his gaze sweeping over the tarot cards on the table. He recognized familiar Major Arcana cards such as “The Magician,” “The Emperor,” “The Hanged Man,” and “Temperance.”
“Comrade Rosterman could really be ‘an elder’... I wonder if he’s from my old country, the Great Empire...” Zhou Mingrui’s lips twitched slightly, a moment of daze washing over him.
He hadn’t had time to examine all the cards laid out on the table when the woman, claiming her divinations were highly accurate, had already gathered all the tarot cards together, stacked them into a pile, and pushed them in front of him.
“You wash and shuffle the cards.” The circus fortune-teller’s voice was low and hoarse.
“I wash?” Zhou Mingrui asked instinctively.
The fortune-teller’s red and yellow face paint seemed to shift, revealing a faint smile. “Of course. Only you can divine your own fate; I am merely an interpreter.”
Zhou Mingrui immediately became wary and asked, “Does interpretation come with an extra charge?”
As a keyboard folklorist, I’ve seen plenty of tricks like this!
The fortune-teller seemed taken aback for a moment, then grumbled, “For free.”
Zhou Mingrui breathed a sigh of relief. He stuffed his left-hand pocket with another round of bullets from his revolver. Then, he placed his palms on the table, shuffling and cutting the cards with practiced ease.
“Done.” He placed the shuffled tarot cards in the center of the table.
The fortune-teller crossed her hands, studying the cards attentively for a moment, then spoke. “Sorry, I forgot to ask. What do you wish to divine?”
Back when he was pursuing his failed **first love**, Zhou Mingrui had studied tarot cards. He answered without hesitation: “The past, the present, and the future.”
This was a three-card tarot spread, with each card representing the past, present, and future respectively.
The fortune-teller nodded first, then her lips curved upward into a smile. “Then please shuffle the cards again. Understand what you wish to ask before shuffling, so that the cards may yield truly symbolic meanings.”
You just played me! How petty is that? Wasn’t it just because I kept emphasizing that it was free?
Zhou Mingrui’s facial muscles twitched. He took a deep breath and retrieved the tarot cards, shuffling and cutting them once more.
“Should be fine this time,” he said, placing the cut cards on the table.
“There’s no more,” the fortune-teller said, extending a finger to pick up the top card and place it to Zhou Mingrui’s left. Her voice grew even lower and hoarser. “This card symbolizes the past.”
“This one symbolizes the present.” She placed the second card in front of Zhou Mingrui.
She picked up the third card and placed it to Zhou Mingrui’s right: “This one symbolizes the future.”
“Alright, which one would you like to see first?” Once she finished, the fortune-teller raised her head, her hazel eyes gazing deeply into Zhou Mingrui’s.
“Let’s start with the ‘present’ card,” Zhou Mingrui said after a moment’s thought.
The fortune-teller nodded slowly and turned over the card in front of him.
The card depicted a young man dressed in splendid clothes, wearing an ornate headpiece, carrying a staff over his shoulder, with luggage hanging from the top of the staff. A small dog pulled at his heels. The number “0” was printed on the card.
“The Fool,” the fortune-teller whispered, her hazel eyes fixed on Zhou Mingrui.
The Fool? The zero card of Tarot? The beginning? The encompassing of all possible beginnings?
Zhou Mingrui, who wasn’t even a beginner in tarot, made a superficial interpretation based on his limited knowledge.
Just as the fortune-teller was about to speak, the tent flap was suddenly thrown open, letting in bright sunlight that forced Zhou Mingrui, who was facing away, to instinctively squint.
“You’re here again, impersonating me! Divination is my job!” A woman’s voice, angry and low, roared. “Go back! Remember, you are nothing but a circus animal trainer!”
Circus animal trainer? Zhou Mingrui adjusted to the light and saw a woman of similar stature, wearing a pointed hat, a black skirt, and red and yellow face paint, standing at the entrance. She was taller and thinner than the one he had just spoken to.
The woman in front of him stood up quickly, looking somewhat crestfallen.
“I apologize, but I simply enjoy this. I must say, sometimes my divinations and interpretations are quite accurate. Truly…”
As she spoke, she lifted her skirt and hurriedly walked around the table, disappearing into the tent.
“Sir, would you like me to interpret something for you?” The real fortune-teller turned to Zhou Mingrui, smiling.
Zhou Mingrui moved his lips slightly and asked sincerely, “For free?”
“…No,” the real fortune-teller replied.
“Then I’ll pass,” Zhou Mingrui said, sliding his hand back into his pocket, pressing the revolver and some coins. He bent down and stepped out of the tent.
This is ridiculous. Finding a circus animal trainer to do tarot divination!
If you’re not a good clown, you shouldn’t pretend to be one!
Zhou Mingrui quickly pushed the incident aside. At the “Lettuce and Meat” market, he bought 1 pound of subpar lamb meat for 7 pennies, along with tender peas, cabbage, onions, potatoes, and other items. Adding the bread he had bought earlier, the total cost was 25 copper pennies, equivalent to 2 Soli and 1 Penny.
“What rotten money, **Benson**…” Zhou Mingrui muttered casually, no longer thinking about it. He hurriedly returned home.
With the main ingredients, it was time to perform the ritual!
…
After the upstairs tenants had all left, Zhou Mingrui didn’t rush to perform the ritual. Instead, he first translated the terms “Fu Sheng Xuan Huang Xian Zun” and others into Old Fasak and Loen Kingdom dialects. He planned to try the original spell first; if it didn’t work, he would try translating it into the local language the next day!
After all, he had to consider the differences between the two realms and follow the local customs.
As for translating it into the ancient prayers and sacrifices used in Hermes, Zhou Mingrui found it difficult due to his limited vocabulary.
Once he finished this, he took out four rye loaves from the paper bag. He placed one in the corner where the coal stove used to be, one at the bottom of the wardrobe on the inside, one at the junction of the two walls on the top shelf, and one in the cluttered area near his desk.
Taking a deep breath, Zhou Mingrui walked to the center of the room. He calmed himself for a few minutes before taking a solemn step, moving in a counterclockwise square.
On the first step, he whispered: “Fu Sheng Xuan Huang Xian Zun.”
On the second step, he sincerely muttered: “Fu Sheng Xuan Huang Tian Jun.”
On the third step, Zhou Mingrui held his breath and whispered: “Fu Sheng Xuan Huang Shang Di.”
On the fourth step, he exhaled and silently recited: “Fu Sheng Xuan Huang Tian Zun.”
Returning to his starting position, Zhou Mingrui closed his eyes and waited on the spot, his heart filled with anticipation, unease, hope, and fear.
Could he return?
Would the ritual be effective?
Would something unexpected happen?
The darkness before his eyes seemed to tinge with the red of the light, and the thoughts swirling in his mind were chaotic and could not be calmed.
Just then, he suddenly felt as if the air around him had stopped moving, becoming viscous and eerie.
Following this, a low murmur entered his ears, one that was sometimes subtle, sometimes sharp, sometimes ethereal, sometimes tempting, sometimes restless, sometimes mad. Even though he couldn’t understand the whispers, Zhou Mingrui couldn’t help but listen and try to discern their meaning.
His head began to ache violently, as if a steel spike had been driven into it.
Zhou Mingrui felt his head would burst. His thoughts were clouded with a hallucinatory haze.
He knew something was wrong. He tried desperately to open his eyes but couldn’t manage even the simplest action.
His whole body grew increasingly tense, as if ready to snap. Out of nowhere, a self-mocking thought crossed his mind:
“If you don’t seek death, you won’t find it…”
Unable to bear it any longer, just as the string in his mind was about to snap, the cacophony of voices and whispers receded. The surrounding area became incredibly quiet, the atmosphere strangely ethereal.
Not only the atmosphere, but Zhou Mingrui also felt his body becoming similarly ethereal.
He tried to open his eyes once more, and this time, it was effortless.
A translucent mist, gray and boundless, entered his vision.
“What is this?” Zhou Mingrui looked around in astonishment, then looked down and saw himself floating on the edge of an endless gray mist.
The mist flowed like water, dotted with countless deep red “stars.” Some were large, some were small, some were hidden deep within, and others floated on the surface.
Observing this holographic-like scene, Zhou Mingrui extended his right hand hesitantly, half in confusion and half in exploration, attempting to touch one of the deep red “stars” floating on the surface to the right, hoping to find a way to leave.
As soon as his fingers touched the surface of the red “star,” ripples surged from his body, startling the “star” into an eruption, like a dreamlike fireworks display.
Zhou Mingrui jumped in fright and hastily withdrew his hand. In the process, he accidentally brushed against another “star.”
That “star” also flared into light.
Zhou Mingrui felt his head empty and his spirit scattered.
…
In the capital city of Loen Kingdom, Backlund, within a luxurious villa in the Queen’s Quarter.
Audrey Holm sat in front of her dressing table, stroking an ancient, cracked copper mirror on the table.
“Magic mirror, wake up…”
“I command you in the name of the Holm family to awaken!”
…
She tried various phrases, but the mirror remained unresponsive.
After more than ten minutes, she finally gave up, pouting in frustration and muttering softly:
“Dad was indeed deceiving me. He always tells me this mirror is a treasure of the ancient Solian Empire’s Black Emperor, a supernatural item.”
As soon as she finished speaking, the copper mirror on the table suddenly emitted a deep red glow, enveloping her instantly.
…
On the Sini Sea, a three-masted sailing ship, clearly outdated, navigated through a violent storm.
Algernon Wilson stood on the deck, his body swaying with the ship’s movements, effortlessly maintaining his balance.
Dressed in a long robe adorned with lightning patterns, he held a strangely shaped glass bottle. Bubbles occasionally churned within the bottle, frost sometimes condensed into snow, and sometimes, the bottle seemed to be carved by the wind.
“I still need the blood of a ghost shark…” Algernon muttered.
Just then, a deep red light erupted between the glass bottle and his hand, instantly engulfing the surrounding area.
…
Above a field of gray and white mist, Audrey Holm’s vision returned. She looked left and right in fear and confusion. Across from her, a man with a blurred head and indistinct figure was doing the same.
Almost simultaneously, they both noticed a mysterious figure, surrounded by a gray mist, standing not far away.
Zhou Mingrui was equally stunned.
“Sir, where are we?”
“What do you intend to do?”
Audrey and Algernon were both taken aback, falling silent for a moment, before speaking in unison.

**Chapter Title**: Chapter 6 - The Beyonder

**Chunk Index**: 1

**Previous Chunk Tail**: (None)

---

The same Runian language, the same heavy and tense feeling.
Where is this? What am I supposed to do? I wonder too... Zhou Mingrui composed himself and silently repeated the questions posed by the two individuals.
What struck him most profoundly, however, was not the sentences formed by the words, nor the meanings they held, but the palpable panic, vigilance, fear, and reverence exhibited by the man and the woman!
Unthinkingly pulling two people into this expanse of grey mist, even as the "culprit" himself felt an unprecedented shock and disbelief, let alone those who were merely passive participants!

From their perspective, such an event, such an encounter, must surely transcend the bounds of imagination, wouldn't it?
In that very instant, Zhou Mingrui contemplated two choices. One was to pretend he was also a victim, conceal his true identity, and thereby secure a measure of trust to observe the unfolding events, to navigate the murky waters unobtrusively. The other was to maintain the enigmatic and inscrutable image they perceived, actively steering the course of events to extract valuable information.

There was no time for further contemplation or meticulous weighing of options. Seizing upon the fleeting thought that had crossed his mind, Zhou Mingrui swiftly made his decision, opting for the second course of action.
Leverage their current psychological state and seize the greatest advantage!

A brief silence hung in the grey mist above. Zhou Mingrui let out a soft chuckle, his tone calm and unassuming, his voice low but not heavy, as if responding to a polite inquiry from visitors:
"A trial."
A trial... A trial? Audrey Hall stared at the enigmatic man obscured by the grey mist, finding the situation absurd, laughable, horrifying, and bizarre all at once.
She had been in her bedroom, standing before her dressing table, and in the blink of an eye, she had "come" to this place teeming with grey mist!
How utterly inconceivable!
Audrey took a deep breath, revealing an impeccable, polite smile, her voice laced with considerable apprehension as she inquired:
"Sir, has the trial concluded? May we return now?"

Alger Wilson, too, entertained a similar test, but his extensive experience rendered him more composed. He suppressed his impulse and remained silent, merely observing from the periphery.
Zhou Mingrui turned his gaze towards the inquirer. Through the blur, he could faintly discern the outline of the other party—a tall maiden with soft, honey-blonde hair—but her specific features remained indistinct.
He did not rush to answer the maiden's question. Instead, he turned his attention to the man seated beside her. His dark blue hair, wild as kelp, framed a medium-built figure that lacked substantial ruggedness.
In that very moment, Zhou Mingrui suddenly gained a measure of clarity. When he grew stronger, or when his understanding of this grey mist world deepened, perhaps he could truly penetrate the veiled obscurity, discern the true visages of the maiden and the man.
In this incident, they were the guests, and he, the host!
A shift in mindset allowed Zhou Mingrui to perceive details he had previously overlooked.
The voice of the sweet-voiced maiden and the steady, contained man alike felt ethereal, tinged with a faint crimson, as if projections of the two deep-red "Stars" upon the surface of the grey mist.
This projection stemmed from the connection between himself and the deep-red entity—an invisible yet palpable link.
If this connection were severed, the projection would dissipate, and they would return... Zhou Mingrui gave an almost imperceptible nod, his gaze fixed on the golden-haired maiden as he smiled softly:
"Certainly, if you formally request it, I can send you back now."

Finding no malice in the man's tone, Audrey breathed a sigh of relief. Trusting that a gentleman capable of such astonishing feats would undoubtedly uphold his word, she did not immediately press for departure. Instead, her emerald eyes darted left and right, a peculiar gleam igniting within them.
Her voice, a mixture of trepidation, anticipation, and eagerness, resonated as she spoke:
"This has been quite an extraordinary experience... Well, I have always anticipated something like this. I mean, I enjoy the mysterious, the miracles that surpass the natural order. No, my focus, I mean, Sir, what should I do to become a Beyonder?"

The more she spoke, the more exhilarated she became, even bordering on incoherence. The dreams that had germinated in her childhood, sparked by tales of the bizarre and supernatural recounted by her elders, seemed to finally hold the promise of fruition.
In the span of a few sentences, the earlier fear and panic had receded from her mind, replaced by curiosity and excitement.
Ask well! I also wonder about the answer... Zhou Mingrui internally chided himself.

He began to ponder how to respond in a manner that preserved an air of mystery and inscrutability.
Simultaneously, he felt that standing in conversation here felt rather mundane. In a scene like this, shouldn't there be a temple, a long table, and numerous armchairs carved with ancient patterns, steeped in an aura of mystery, upon which he would sit at the highest seat, silently gazing at his guests?

As soon as this thought crossed his mind, the grey mist surged violently, startling Audrey and Alger.
In the blink of an eye, they observed tall stone columns springing into existence around them, and above, a vast dome came into view.
The architecture was magnificent, grand, and imposing, as if it were the throne hall of legendary giants.
Beneath the central point of the dome, where the grey mist swirled, appeared a bronze long table, with ten high-backed chairs on either side, and similar seats positioned in front and behind. The backs of the chairs shimmered with a brilliance that defied reality, outlining strange constellations unseen in the mortal world.
Audrey and Alger found themselves seated opposite each other, occupying the positions closest to the head of the table.

The maiden glanced left, then right, unable to suppress a low mutter:
"What an astonishing sight..."
Indeed, it was astonishing... Zhou Mingrui extended his right hand, lightly tracing the edge of the bronze table—a motion so subtle it barely disturbed the surface.

Alger, too, took in the surroundings. After a few seconds of silence, he suddenly spoke, answering Audrey's question on behalf of Zhou Mingrui:
"You are a Runian, aren't you?"
"If you wish to become a Beyonder, join the Church of the Evernight Goddess, the Church of the Lord of Storms, or the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery."
"Though the vast majority of people may never encounter a supernatural being in their entire lives, even doubting the existence of the churches themselves, and within the major churches, many clergy share such doubts, I can unequivocally tell you that in the Tribunal, the Court of Judgment, and the execution agencies, Supernaturals still exist, still combating the dangers that grow in the darkness. However, their numbers are vastly reduced compared to the early Black Iron Age or before."

He listened intently, his body language betraying none of his focus. Drawing upon the historical knowledge left behind by Cai Lian, he understood that the "Black Iron Age" referred to the current era, the Fifth Era, beginning thirteen hundred forty-nine years ago.

Audrey listened quietly, then exhaled softly:
"Sir, I know what you're saying, even more than that—like the Nighthawks, the Mandated Punishers, the Machinery Hivemind. But, I am unwilling to lose my freedom."

Alger let out a low chuckle, speaking ambiguously:
"Is there no cost to becoming a Supernatural without considering joining a church, undergoing trials, or seeking out the Royal House, noble families with millennia of history, or perhaps stumbling upon hidden邪恶 organizations?"

Audrey instinctively puffed out her cheeks, then hastily glanced left and right, ensuring that the mysterious gentleman and the man opposite had not noticed her little gesture before pressing further:
"Is there no other way?"

Alger fell silent. After several breaths, he turned his head towards the silent, unresponsive "mysterious gentleman," Zhou Mingrui.
Observing that the other party offered no comment, he then turned back to Audrey, choosing his words carefully:
"I actually possess two Sequence 9 Potion recipes."

Sequence 9? Zhou Mingrui murmured to himself.
"Really? Which two?"

Audrey's eyes lit up with recognition. She clearly understood what Sequence 9 Potion recipes represented.
Alger leaned back slightly, his tone measured:
"As you know, for humans to become true Beyonders, they must rely on Potions. The names of these Potions derive from the 'profane stone tablet,' having undergone continuous translation through Goblin, Elven, Ancient Hermes, Ancient Feysac, and contemporary Hermes languages, evolving to align with the characteristics of each era. The name itself is not the key; the crucial factor is whether it embodies the 'core symbol' of the Potion."

"The Sequence 9 recipes I possess," Alger continued without pause, "one is called 'Mariner.' It grants you exceptional balance, allowing you to walk firmly on the deck even during a tempest. You will also gain remarkable strength and hidden scales beneath your skin, making you as slippery as a fish, difficult to grasp. In water, you will move with the agility of sea creatures, able to dive for at least ten minutes without any equipment."

"Sounds excellent... The 'Sea眷者' of the Lord of Storms?" Audrey asked, half in expectation, half in verification.

"In ancient times, it was indeed called 'Sea眷者,'" Alger replied without hesitation. "The second Sequence 9 recipe is called 'Audience.' As for what it was called in ancient times, I do not know. This Potion enhances your mental acuity and sharpens your observational skills. Having seen operas and plays, you can understand what 'Audience' signifies—it is like being a spectator, examining the 'actors' within the mundane world, discerning their true intentions through their expressions, their mannerisms, their speech quirks, and their unseen actions."

Here, Alger emphasized:
"You must remember, whether in lavish banquets or bustling streets, the audience is always merely an audience."

Audrey's eyes sparkled with excitement. It took her a while to speak:
"Why? Well, that's a follow-up question. I... I've grown fond of this feeling, 'Audience.' How can I obtain the recipe for 'Audience'? What can I offer in exchange?"

Alger, as if prepared for this, responded in a grave tone:
"One hundred milliliters of Ghost Shark blood."

Audrey nodded excitedly at first, then asked with concern:
"If I can acquire it—meaning, if I can—how should I give it to you? And how can I ensure that after you receive the Ghost Shark blood, you will provide me with the Potion recipe, and that it is genuine?"

Alger replied calmly:
"I will give you an address. Once I receive the Ghost Shark blood, I will send the recipe back to you, or inform you of it here directly."

"As for assurance," he continued, "I believe the presence of this mysterious gentleman will suffice to put both of us at ease."

Saying this, he directed his gaze towards Zhou Mingrui seated at the head of the table:
"Sir, you brought us here with your incomprehensible means, bestowing upon us powers beyond our wildest imaginations. Your testimony, whether from me or her, carries undeniable weight and cannot be disobeyed."

"Exactly!" Audrey exclaimed, her eyes shining with fervent agreement.
In her view, the mysterious gentleman whose methods defied comprehension was indeed a figure of sufficient "authority" to serve as a witness.
How could she, or the man opposite, dare to deceive him!

Half-turning her body, Audrey looked earnestly at Zhou Mingrui:
"Sir, please act as our witness for this transaction."

At that moment, she realized she had forgotten to ask a crucial question, one that lacked basic courtesy. Hastily, she inquired:
"Sir, how should we address you?"

Alger nodded slightly and followed suit, asking solemnly:
"Sir, how should we address you?"

Zhou Mingrui paused, a slight surprise flickering in his eyes. His fingers, resting on the bronze table, tapped rhythmically. Suddenly, the content of his previous divination flashed through his mind.
He leaned back, withdrawing his right hand and crossing his arms over his chest. A serene smile played upon his lips as he gazed at the two before him:
"You may call me..."

Pausing briefly, he continued, his tone gentle yet unassuming:
"The Fool."

**Chapter Title:** Chapter 7: Code Name

**English Draft:**

"The Fool," the concise answer faded into the vast sanctuary and the pervasive mist, yet within the hearts of Audrey and Archer, its echoes lingered, stirring ripple upon ripple of profound reverberation.

Unexpected, yet fittingly so. A title that perfectly encapsulated mystery, power, and strangeness!

A brief silence ensued, broken by Audrey rising. She lifted the hem of her skirt lightly, bent her knees, and offered a formal salute to Zhou Mingrui.
"Esteemed Sir The Fool, allow me the audacity to beseech you: could you serve as a witness to our transaction?"
"Trivial matter," Zhou Mingrui thought swiftly, replying in a manner befitting his station.
"It is an honour, Sir The Fool," Archer echoed, rising and bowing with his right hand over his heart.

Zhou Mingrui waved his right hand dismissively, a faint smile touching his lips as he spoke.
"You continue," he said.

Archer nodded, resettling himself, then turned to Audrey.
"If you can acquire the Ghost Shark's blood, arrange for it to be sent to the 'Warriors and Sea' tavern on Pelican Street, in the White Rose District of Prizzi Port. Inform the owner, Williams, that this is 'Captain's' request."

"How do you intend to proceed?" Zhou Mingrui inquired, his mind racing to formulate a response. "Will you provide me with the address and mail the potion recipe forward, or shall you convey the recipe here directly?"

Audrey pondered for a moment, a smile finally blooming on her face.
"I choose the more discreet method," she declared, "here and now, though it certainly tests the limits of one's memory."

Should Sir The Fool agree to witness the transaction, it implied the potential for recurring 'gatherings' in the future.
A thought struck her, turning her head with a spark in her eyes as she playfully suggested,
"Sir The Fool, would you mind partaking in such 'experiments' more frequently?"

Archer, listening intently, felt a thrill of excitement. Hastily, he concurred.
"Sir The Fool, do you not find these 'gatherings' most intriguing? Though your power surpasses our wildest imaginations, there remain domains unfamiliar and perhaps beyond your expertise. That lady, clearly of noble birth, possesses her own unique experiences, knowledge, channels, and resources. Between us, we might accomplish certain tasks, those perhaps unsuitable for you to undertake directly."

He reasoned that his own unprepared and defenseless inclusion in this circle signified the Sir's dominant control. Resistance or disengagement were not viable options. Therefore, it was wiser to delve deeper into the benefits of this encounter, to harvest advantages from the perceived disadvantage.

Three distinct individuals sat around the long table, each possessing disparate backgrounds, resources, information channels, and understanding of the occult. Mutual exchange and limited cooperation could yield results of incalculable and immeasurable wonder!

Consider the resource exchange just agreed upon. Should he wish to eliminate an individual, for instance, he could readily enlist the aid of a 'gatherings member' seemingly unrelated to the matter, ensuring the affair would be misconstrued entirely.

The noble lady... Had my demeanor, my accent, betrayed my origins so plainly? Audrey's mouth parted slightly, her mind momentarily stunned. Yet, she quickly regained her composure, nodding decisively.
"Sir The Fool, I believe this is an excellent proposal. Provided the 'gathering' becomes a regular affair, certain tasks for which you might be unwilling or unsuited to handle directly could be delegated to us. Naturally, within our capabilities."

From the outset, Zhou Mingrui had been weighing the pros and cons. More 'gatherings' undoubtedly promised greater access to anomalous mysteries and esoteric knowledge, potentially aiding his return journey in the future. Consider the potion recipe for 'The Spectator' expected to appear at the next gathering. Simultaneously, such meetings could provide intelligence and tangible assistance for his present reality.

Yet, increased gatherings also heightened the risk of exposing his true nature!

Indeed, no matter the world, there existed no purely beneficial undertaking.

Zhou Mingrui extended his right hand again, lightly tapping the edge of the long table.

Given that the convening and dissolution of the 'gathering' remained under his purview, any potential exposure could be managed. The benefits clearly outweighed the drawbacks, leading to a swift decision.

He ceased his tapping, meeting the four expectant yet apprehensive gazes with a faint smile.
"I am one who values equitable exchange," he stated.
"I shall not allow you to assist without reciprocity."

"Each Monday, at three o'clock," he continued, "ensure solitude. After I have conducted a few more trials and clarified certain matters, perhaps you will be able to attend earlier, avoiding unsuitable circumstances."

This constituted agreement to Archer and Audrey's proposal.

Audrey, barely seventeen, accustomed to pampered indulgence, felt a thrill of anticipation. Gripping her hands into fists, she lightly swayed them over her chest.
"Then, should we not assign ourselves codenames? After all, using our real names would be imprudent."

Although her true circumstances might not escape Sir The Fool's notice, the other party also posed a certain danger; she could not risk revealing her identity!

"An excellent suggestion," Zhou Mingrui replied succinctly and lightly.

Audrey immediately set to pondering, elaborating her thoughts.
"You are Sir The Fool, originating from the Tarot. As a regular, long-term, clandestine 'gathering', our titles ought to be consistent, yes? I shall select mine from the Tarot as well."

Her tone gradually lightened.
"Determined! My title shall be, 'Justice'!"

One of the twenty-two Major Arcana cards.

"And for you, sir?" Audrey asked, her eyes sparkling as she looked at the 'associate' opposite her.

Archer frowned slightly, then relaxed.
"The Hanged Man."

Another Major Arcana.

"Excellent," Audrey exclaimed, a hint of shyness creeping into her voice as she turned to Zhou Mingrui, obscured by the grey-white mist. "Shall we consider ourselves the founding members of the Tarot Circle?"
"Is there any objection, Sir The Fool?" she inquired.

Zhou Mingrui shook his head with a faint amusement.
"Concerning such trivialities, you are empowered to decide for yourselves."

"Thank you!" Audrey's excitement was palpable.

She then turned to Archer.
"Mr. The Hanged Man, might you repeat the address, please? I fear my memory may not retain it sufficiently."

"No problem," Archer replied, satisfied with Audrey's diligence. He repeated the address.

After silently reciting it three times, Audrey continued with renewed enthusiasm.
"I've heard that the Tarot was merely a game invented by Rosier Emperor, possessing no actual divination capabilities?"

"No," Archer countered, glancing at Zhou Mingrui who gave no indication to intervene. "Divination often stems from within. Each individual possesses a spirit, capable of perceiving the spirit realm, sensing information from higher levels. However, common folk cannot perceive this, let alone interpret the 'hints' received. When they employ divination tools, these messages manifest through them. A simple example is dreams and dream interpretation." He continued, "The Tarot is essentially such a tool. It utilizes more symbolic elements and rational components to facilitate the convenient and accurate interpretation of 'hints'."

Zhou Mingrui appeared nonchalant, yet his mind processed the information meticulously. However, his spiritual disconnection intensified, a sharp, pulsating pain lancing through his skull.

"Understood," Audrey nodded, seeking clarification. "My meaning was not that. I am not questioning the Tarot's validity. I have heard whispers that Rosier Emperor actually devised a hidden set of cards, symbolizing certain unknown forces, a deck of twenty-two cards. Only after completing this did he formulate the twenty-two Major Arcana cards we know today, using them as a game mechanism. Is this accurate?"

She regarded Zhou Mingrui, hoping for an answer from the enigmatic Sir.

Zhou Mingrui merely smiled, offering no verbal response, his gaze shifting towards 'The Hanged Man', as if testing him.

Archer instinctively straightened his posture, speaking with a measured tone.
"Yes, it is said Rosier Emperor viewed the profane stone tablet, and that deck of cards concealed the secrets of the twenty-two **Pathways of the Gods**."

"Twenty-two **Pathways of the Gods**..." Audrey repeated, her voice imbued with a tone of profound awe.

At that moment, Zhou Mingrui's headache intensified, the invisible connection between himself and the Crimson Star, the Grey Haze, feeling unstable.

"Enough for today," he decreed decisively, his voice low and final.

"Your will is our command," Archer bowed his head.

"Your will is our command," Audrey echoed, imitating 'The Hanged Man'.

She had countless questions and ideas, unwilling to part so soon.

As he severed the connection, Zhou Mingrui offered a faint smile.
"Let us anticipate the next gathering."

The 'Stars' lightened, the crimson glow receding like water. Before Audrey and Archer could fully grasp the 'Fool's' words, their forms began to blur, becoming increasingly ethereal.

In less than a second, the 'projection' dissolved, leaving the Grey Haze utterly silent once more.

Zhou Mingrui felt a sudden heaviness, as if his body had become lead. The surroundings seemed to drift away, darkness enveloping his vision before brilliant sunlight pierced through.

He remained within his apartment, standing in the center of the room.

"A dream... what exactly is that Grey Haze place? Who, or what force, orchestrated that transformation...?" Zhou Mingrui murmured softly, a profound sense of bewilderment washing over him. His legs felt weighted, dragging him towards the desk.

He retrieved the watch he had placed outside, checking the elapsed time.

"One-to-one temporal flow," he estimated.

Setting the watch down, the excruciating pain in his head made further resistance futile. He sank into the chair, lowering his head and using his left thumb and index finger to massage the temples on either side of his head.

After a long moment, a sigh escaped him. He spoke in Chinese.
"Apparently, I cannot return anytime soon..."

The uninformed could be reckless. Having witnessed such marvels, gained insight into the anomalous domains and esoteric realms, Zhou Mingrui dared not attempt the 'Fortune-Changing Ritual' in Ancient Feysac or Ruin again!

Who knew what other, perhaps more bizarre, more terrifying, even life-ruining, scenarios might arise!

"At least, not until I have a thorough grasp of the occult," he thought helplessly.

Still, the so-called 'gatherings' offered him assistance.

A heavy silence settled upon him. With a mixture of frustration, disappointment, pain, and melancholy, he murmured to himself.
"From this point forward, I shall be克莱恩."

...

克莱恩 forced his thoughts towards plans and strategies, endeavoring to dispel the negative emotions churning within him.

Next week, perhaps, he could overhear the recipe for 'The Spectator' potion...

That 'gathering' had been quite remarkable. People from different parts of the world, bridging thousands of miles as if mere inches apart, face-to-face interaction, bartering goods and services... it sounded familiar.

克莱恩 paused for a few seconds, suddenly chuckling to himself. He pressed his temple with his hand, whispering a self-mocking remark.
"Let's give some online dating platforms a try?"

**Chapter Title:** The Dawn of a New Era

**English Draft:**

**Part 1: The Tempest at Sea**

Aaaah!
The wind howled, the rain fell in torrents, the three-masted ship surged between wave after wave, cresting and plunging, tossed like a toy by the giants of the sea.

Algernon Wilson’s eyes, once shadowed with a deep, unnerving red, seemed to fade, leaving him still standing on the deck, unchanged from before.

Then, he witnessed the peculiar glass bottle in his hand, grotesque in shape, shatter with a crisp *crack*. Frost, snow-like, melted into water, mingling with the raindrops.

In mere seconds, the ancient artifact was utterly gone, leaving no trace of its former existence.

A shard of crystalline snow, hexagonal in form, appeared in Algernon’s palm. It rapidly dissipated, vanishing as if receding into the flesh itself.

Algernon nodded almost imperceptibly, as if pondering something profound. He remained utterly still for five long minutes.

Turning his body, he walked towards the ship’s cabin entrance. Just as he was about to enter, he met a man stepping out, clad in a robe adorned with electric blue lightning patterns.

The man with the soft, honey-blonde hair paused, his gaze fixed on Algernon. He extended his right hand, fist clenched over his chest.

"Storm with you."

Algernon’s face, rugged and profound, devoid of any extraneous emotion, mirrored the gesture, clenching his own right fist over his left breast.

After exchanging formal greetings, Algernon entered the cabin, moving down the passageway towards the captain’s quarters beyond.

Throughout his journey, he encountered no sailors or crewmen. The ship was unnervingly silent, as still and empty as the interior of a tomb.

The captain’s door opened, revealing a plush, deep-brown carpet. Bookshelves and a liquor cabinet lined the sides. Yellowed bookbindings and dark, crimson wine bottles gleamed with an otherworldly light under the flickering candlelight.

On the candlelit desk sat an inkwell, a quill pen, a black metal telescope, and a brass sextant.

Behind the desk, a middle-aged man, pale-faced, wearing a skull captain’s hat, watched Algernon approach. His lips curled in fury as he ground his teeth.

"I will not yield!"

"You can do it," Algernon replied, his voice calm as if commenting on the day’s weather.

"You..." The man froze, utterly unprepared for such a response.

In that instant, Algernon’s body tensed, and he lunged forward, closing the distance between them to mere inches.

*Crack!*

His shoulder tightened, and his right hand shot out, clamping onto the man’s throat before he could react.

Phantomscales shimmered on his hand, and his fingers flexed with terrifying strength.

*Clink!*

With a sharp sound, the man’s eyes widened in shock as he was lifted entirely off his feet.

His legs thrashed violently, but his expression quickly settled into a blank stare. His pupils dilated, and the area beneath his trousers began to dampen, accompanied by a foul stench.

Algernon hoisted the man, bent his back, and took a stride towards the wall beside him.

*Thump!* He used the man as a shield, slamming him forcefully against the forward wall.

The wooden panels splintered and shattered. The狂暴的风雨, carrying the briny tang of the sea, surged into the cabin.

Algernon twisted his torso, and with a throw, he sent the man crashing out of the cabin and into the churning sea, cresting wave upon cresting wave.

Darkness, howling wind, and the raw power of nature swallowed everything.

Algernon pulled out a white handkerchief, wiped his right palm clean, and then tossed it into the sea.

Stepping back, he waited patiently for his companion to enter.

"What happened?" Within seconds, the man with the honey-blonde hair burst in.

"The Captain... escaped," Algernon panted, his tone tinged with frustration. "He still retains some...非凡之力!"

"Damn it!" The blonde man cursed under his breath.

He moved to the breach in the wall, staring intently into the distance. But all he saw was wind, rain, and the churning sea.

"Let it be," the blonde man waved a dismissive hand. "He was merely an incidental. Finding this Tudor ghost ship is our gain."

Even for a favored servant of the sea, he dared not risk venturing into the water in this weather.

"And if the storm continues," Algernon nodded, noting the visible, almost animate repair of the wooden wall. "The Captain won’t last much longer."

He cast a sidelong glance, his head twisting instinctively towards the helm and the sails.

Through layers of wood, he could perceive their state.

No first mate. No second mate. No sailors. No ordinary seamen. Not a single living soul.

The helm and sails adjusted themselves, silently and unnervingly.

A vision of the man obscured by grey and white mist, "The Fool," flashed in his mind. Algernon sighed, a sound of weary resignation.

He turned to the raging storm outside, his voice a fragmented whisper, laced with both anticipation and dread.

"A new era has begun..."

**Part 2: The Heart of the City**

In the Queen's Quarter, the capital of Loen Kingdom, Backlund, Audrye Holl nipped her cheek, unable to fathom what had just transpired.

Before her, the antique copper mirror on her dressing table lay in shattered fragments.

Lowering her gaze, Audrye saw the "Deep Red" flowing across her hand, like a tattoo of stars.

The "Deep Red" gradually faded, vanishing beneath her skin.

Only then did Audrye confirm that she was not dreaming.

Her eyes flickered with a liquid light, her lips curved slowly upwards. She stood, bending to gather her skirts.

With a curtsey to the empty air, Audrye moved with light steps, her body turning fluidly. She danced the "Ancient Elven Dance," the latest宫廷流行舞, a radiant smile blooming on her face.

*Tap-tap-tap!* The door to her room was knocked upon.

"Who is it?" Audrye stopped abruptly, assuming a demure posture.

"Miss, may I enter? It is time for you to prepare," her lady’s maid asked from outside the door.

Audrye glanced sideways at the broken mirror, quickly suppressing her smile, leaving only a faint line.

She examined herself left and right, satisfied with her appearance, then spoke softly.

"Enter."

Twisting her wrist, her lady’s maid, Annie, pushed the door open.

"Oh, it’s shattered…" Annie immediately noticed the state of the antique mirror.

Audrye blinked, her voice slow and deliberate.

"Well, yes, um, Susie was here, you know. It just… likes to break things!" Susie was a large, golden retriever with less than pure lineage, a gift from her father, Baron Holl, while hunting foxes, but dearly loved by Audrye.

"You need to discipline her properly," Annie said, expertly cleaning up the mirror shards, careful not to cut her mistress.

Finished, she looked at Audrye, a small smile playing on her lips.

"What dress would you like?"

"Ah, the one designed by Mistress Ginny for my seventeenth birthday," Audrye replied, thinking.

"No, that’s impossible. If someone were to see you wearing it again in a formal occasion, they would question the Holl family’s financial stability!" Annie shook her head.

"But I truly adore it," Audrye insisted, her tone gentle.

"You can wear it at home, in less formal settings," Annie stated firmly.

"Then the one Sir Sedus brought yesterday, the one with the lace at the sleeves," Audrye said, holding her breath, maintaining her elegant, sweet smile.

"You always have such excellent taste," Annie smiled, stepping back towards the door. "Number Six wardrobe, never mind, I’ll get it myself."

The maids sprang into action. One took charge of the gown, another of the jewels, another of the shoes, another of the silk hat, one for dressing Audrye, and one for considering the hairstyle.

As preparations wound down, the Baron, wearing a dark brown waistcoat and matching hat, with neatly trimmed sideburns, appeared at the doorway. His sapphire eyes held a cheerful glint, though the loose muscles, protruding belly, and deepening法令 lines marred the handsome man he once was.

"The jewel of Backlund, it is time to depart," Baron Holl announced, standing at the entrance, lightly tapping the open door.

"Father, please do not call me that," Audrye said, rising with her maid’s assistance, feigning a touch of vexation.

"Then, my lovely princess, it is time to go," the Baron bent his left arm, gesturing for her to take his arm.

Audrye offered a faint smile and shook her head.

"This is Lady Holl, your mother. Her place."

"Then this way," the Baron smiled, bending his right arm. "This is the pride of a father."

**Part 3: The Ironclad and the Age of Steam**

When Audrye, arm-in-arm with her father, descended from the carriage at Priz Port, Oak Island, Royal Naval Base, she was struck dumb by the behemoth before her.

In the nearby harbor lay a vessel of staggering proportions, its entire body shimmering with metallic glory. Gone were the sails, replaced by two towering smokestacks and two open-air gun turrets, one forward, one aft. It stood majestic, immense, dwarfing the nearby sailing battleships, which looked like mere children beside its colossus.

"By the storm..."

"Oh, my God."

"Ironclad!"

The murmurs rose, a low, collective gasp. Audrye felt the same awe, the wonder of human ingenuity, a miracle of the sea unlike any before.

It took an indeterminate time for the nobles, ministers, and members of the House of Commons to regain their composure. Just then, a black dot appeared in the sky, growing larger, blotting out a third of the heavens, commanding all attention and casting a sudden pall over the scene.

A colossal creature drifted and flew through the air. Its lines were incredibly fluid and elegant, painted in deep blue. A sturdy, light alloy frame supported the fabric housing airbags below, with casings for cannons, grenade launchers, and flat-trajectory guns visible on its underbelly. The cacophony of high-spirit steam engines and the frantic whirring of the propellers formed a symphony of awe-inspiring power.

The royal family’s airship had arrived, its descent marked by an air of supreme authority.

On either side of the carriage compartment, the "Judgment Sword" emblem, a vertical sword set with a ruby crown, reflected the sunlight. A symbol of the Augusta family, its legacy stretching back to the previous era.

Audrye, not yet eighteen, had not undergone the "Introduction Ceremony," the formal entry into Backlund’s social scene presided over by the Queen, signifying her adulthood. She could only observe from the sidelines, unable to approach.

Still, she paid it little mind, even feeling a sense of relief at not having to mingle with the princes.

The "miracle" of human flight settled onto the ground. First out climbed youthful guardsmen, clad in red uniforms and white trousers, bearing rifles, standing at rigid attention, forming two ranks as King George III and his family, along with the princes and princesses, emerged.

Audrye hadn’t seen royalty often, but she showed no interest. Her gaze drifted to the two black-armored knights standing beside the monarch, like stone statues.

In this age of steel, steam, and artillery, there were still men clad head-to-toe in armor!

The cold gleam of the metal, the deep black of the helmets, radiated a sense of weight, solemnity, and unquestioning obedience.

"Could they be the higher-tier 'Disciplinarian Knights'..." Audrye thought of idle conversations among her family’s elders. Curious, yet daunted, she dared not come closer.

With the king’s family arrived, the ceremony began. Lord Agughe Ngen, the current Secretary of State for War and the Navy, stepped forward.

A conservative figure, one of only two non-noble prime ministers to date, he had been elevated to Lord for his exceptional contributions.

But Audrye knew more. His elder brother, the mainstay of the Conservatives, was Lord Palas Ngen, the Duke of this generation!

Agughe, in his late fifties, thin and somewhat balding, with sharp, piercing eyes, surveyed the crowd.

"Ladies and gentlemen," he began, his voice resonating with authority. "You have seen it. This is an ironclad, a vessel capable of overturning the tides of history. Length: 101 meters. Beam: 21 meters. Height: Designed around the main deck. Main armor belt: 457mm thick. Displacement: 10,060 tons. Four 305mm main guns, forward and aft. Additionally, six rapid-fire guns, eighteen 6-pounders, and forty-six six-barreled machine guns. Four torpedo tubes. Speed: Up to 16 knots!"

"It shall be the undisputed master of the waves! It shall conquer the sea!"

Nobleman, ministers, and parliamentarians stirred uneasily. Even Agughe’s description painted a terrifying picture, but the sight of the vessel itself confirmed the horror.

A faint smile touched Agughe’s lips. He delivered a few more words before bowing to King George III.

"Majesty, it is time to name it."

"It shall be called 'Priz'," the King announced, his expression clearly pleased.

"Priz!"

"Priz!"

The name spread, passed from the Secretary of State, the Chief of the Naval Staff, onwards, until it reached the officers and men aboard the ironclad, who cheered in unison.

"Hail Priz!"

As celebrations erupted, salvos of artillery echoed through the air. King George III gave the order for departure and trials.

Aaaah!
The whistle blew, thick smoke billowed from the funnels, the sounds of machinery faintly audible.

The leviathan moved. As it cleared the port and opened fire on an uninhabited island ahead with its bow-mounted guns, everyone present gasped.

*BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!*

The earth seemed to tremble. Dust choked the air. A hurricane-force wind whipped across the water, tossing the waves into a frenzy.

Agughe Ngen turned, a satisfied smile on his face. He addressed the nobles, ministers, and parliamentarians.

"From this moment forth, those seven self-styled 'Generals' of piracy, those four who dared to usurp the title of King, can only tremble, awaiting their end!"

"Their era is over. No matter what 'extraordinary power' they may possess, no matter the ghost ships or curses, the sea shall be dominated by the ironclad!"

Just then, Agughe’s chief secretary interjected deliberately.

"But can they build such an ironclad themselves?"

Some nobles and members of parliament nodded silently, considering the possibility.

Agughe’s smile vanished, replaced by a slow shake of his head.

"No. Impossible. Utterly impossible! To construct such a vessel requires three large coal-steel integrated plants, twenty steelworks of a certain scale, the expertise of sixty scientists and countless senior engineers from the Backlund Ordnance Research Institute and the Priz Shipbuilding Research Institute. It demands two Royal Dockyards and their associated hundred-plus component factories, a Ministry of the Navy, a shipbuilding committee, a cabinet, a visionary and resolute monarch, and a nation capable of producing twelve million tons of steel annually!"

"They will never achieve it."

He paused, then raised his arms, his voice booming with fervor.

"Ladies and gentlemen, the age of the great ship and the great gun has dawned!"

**Chapter Title:** Chapter 9: Notes

After resting for half an hour, Zhou Mingrui, having fully assumed the identity of Cai Lian Mo Rui, felt himself regain his composure. During this time, he discovered four black spots on the back of his right hand, arranged in a small square formation.

These four spots faded from darkness to light and vanished quickly, but Cai Lian knew they remained dormant within his body, waiting for the right moment to awaken.

"Four points, a square—does this correspond to the four cardinal directions and their respective main provisions? Perhaps I no longer need to prepare these staples and can directly proceed to the steps and incantations?" Cai Lian vaguely speculated.

It seemed like a promising idea, yet the presence of something inexplicable and foreign within him only intensified the fear. The thought that inexplicable occult practices from Earth could yield results here, coupled with his strange, inexplicable transition into this world, and the enigmatic, hallucinatory Grey Mist realm, all contributed to a chilling shiver that wracked him, even in the sweltering heat of late June.

He had once heard a saying: "Man's oldest and most profound emotion is fear, and the deepest of all fears is the fear of the unknown." Now, Cai Lian deeply felt the terror born from the unknown.

Unprecedented and uncontrollable, a strong impulse surged within him—a desire to delve into the mysteries, to learn more, to unravel the unknown. Yet, there was also a tendency to bury his head in the sand, pretending as if nothing had happened.

The sunlight streaming through the window cast a golden glow upon his desk, as if offering a touch of warmth and hope. He gazed at it, feeling a moment of respite. However, the exhaustion washed over him in an overwhelming tide.

The lack of sleep from the previous night and the recent expenditure of energy weighed heavily upon his eyelids, making them feel leaden and forcing them downward. He shook his head, reached out to support himself on the edge of the desk, and, ignoring the four corners where the rye bread lay, stumbled towards the bunk bed. As soon as he lay down and touched the pillow, he drifted into a deep sleep.

Gurgle! Gurgle!

Hunger awoke him. He opened his eyes, feeling refreshed.

"Besides the lingering headache," he rubbed his temples and sat up, suddenly feeling an appetite so strong he could devour an entire ox.

As he smoothed out the wrinkles in his clothes and returned to the desk, he picked up the silver watch with its vine-like pattern.

Click!

The cover snapped open, and the second hand ticked steadily.

"Half past twelve. I slept for more than three hours..." Cai Lian swallowed, placing the watch into the pocket of his linen shirt.

In the Loen Kingdom, time was divided into twenty-four hours, each hour sixty minutes, and each minute sixty seconds. Whether each second felt the same as on Earth, he could not know.

At that moment, even words like mysticism, rituals, or the Grey Mist world refused to enter his mind. The most pressing matter was sustenance—food! Without food, how could he devise a plan? How could he accomplish anything?

Without hesitation, Cai Lian retrieved the four loaves of rye bread, shook off the faint dust, and planned to use one as his midday meal. Due to his limited five pennies, and influenced by fragments of the original host's memories and habits, he felt it necessary to practice frugality.

After all, gas was too expensive, even for lighting. He moved the stove, added some coal, and paced back and forth, waiting for the water to boil.

Dry-eating rye bread was sure to cause discomfort!

"Ah, does this mean a life of rye bread for breakfast, lunch, and then meat for dinner? No, it’s not that bad. If it weren't for Melissa’s consideration for my upcoming interview, I could only afford meat once a week..."

Cai Lian looked around helplessly, his hunger preventing him from contemplating serious matters.

The thought of the one-pound lamb meat made his eyes take on a greenish hue as he stared at the cabinets.

"No, no, I must wait for Melissa to join me," he shook his head firmly, dismissing the idea of eating alone.

As a lone wanderer in the bustling city, though reliant on eating out, Cai Lian had honed his basic cooking skills. It wasn't gourmet, but it was sufficient.

Turning his body, Cai Lian decided to leave it at that, but just then, he remembered he had also purchased tender peas and potatoes earlier that morning.

Potatoes! Inspiration struck him instantly. He spun around, rushed to the cabinets, and took out two of the few potatoes he had.

He went to the public restroom, washed the potatoes clean, and placed them directly into the pot with the water.

After a while, he retrieved the spice box from the cabinet, opened the lid, and sprinkled a little yellow, coarse salt into the water.

Patiently waiting a few more minutes, Cai Lian poured the thin soup-like liquid into several cups and a large bowl, then took out the potatoes with a fork and placed them on the table.

Huff!

As he peeled a bit of the skin and blew on his hand, the aroma of the cooked potatoes slowly弥漫ed, enticing his appetite.

Saliva flowed uncontrollably. Ignoring the fact that he had only peeled half and the potatoes were still hot, he took a large bite.

Powdered, fragrant, with a hint of sweetness on the palate! Cai Lian's heart swelled with emotion. He devoured the two potatoes with gusto, even eating the skin.

Only then did he pick up the large bowl and take a satisfying sip of the "soup," the faint saltiness cleansing the dryness in his mouth.

"Back when I was a child, I loved this the most..." Cai Lian silently reflected, breaking the rye bread and dipping it into the "soup" to soften it before eating.

Perhaps the previous "ritual" had drained him significantly, as he consumed two loaves, an entire pound. After drinking the "soup" and tidying up, Cai Lian felt truly revitalized, experiencing the joy of being human and basking in the warmth of the sunlight.

He returned to his desk and began to ponder his next steps.

"I cannot evade this. I must find a way to engage with the mysterious domain, to become a 'Beyonder' recognized by 'Justice' and 'The Hanged Man'."

"I must overcome the fear born from the unknown."

"The only path available at the moment is to wait for the next 'gathering,' hoping to overhear the 'Audience Potion' recipe or other esoteric knowledge."

"There are still four days until Monday. Before then, I must confront the issues inherent in the original host. Why did he commit suicide? What happened to him?"

Unable to return to his original world and simply walk away, Cai Lian picked up the open notebook and decided to flip through it, hoping to find clues that might piece together the fragmented memories.

Clearly, the original host had a habit of taking notes and treating them as a diary.

Cai Lian knew that the cabinet beneath his desk was filled with countless completed notebooks.

This particular one started from May 10th, its contents initially focused on school, professors, and academic topics:

"May 12th: Mr. Azir mentioned that the common language of the southern continent's Bayren Empire also originates from Ancient Feysac, a branch of the Giant language. Why is that? Could all sentient beings have once spoken the same language? No, this must be wrong. Even according to the 'Night Revelation' and 'The Book of Storms,' in an era older than antiquity, giants were not the sole rulers of the continents; there were also elves, aberrations, and dragons. Well, these are just legends, mythological stories."

...

"May 16th: I discussed the inevitability of the Steam Age with Senior Professor Cohen and Mr. Azir. Mr. Azir believed it was a matter of chance; without the sudden appearance of Emperor Rosier, perhaps the North Continent would still be in the same state as the South, remaining in the age of cold兵器. My professor, however, felt he overstated the role of individuals. He believed that with the progression of time, without Rosier or Emperor Robert, the Steam Age might be delayed but would eventually arrive. Their debate seemed to me to lack significance. I prefer to discover new things and uncover the obscured history. Perhaps, I shouldn't have studied history; maybe archaeology would be more suitable."

...

"May 29th: Welch found me and said he had obtained a notebook from the Fourth Era. My goddess, a notebook from the Fourth Era! He didn't want to bother his archaeology friends and asked me and Naya for help in deciphering its contents. How could I refuse? Of course, it had to be after the graduation defense, as I couldn't afford to be distracted at this time."

Here, Cai Lian's spirits lifted. Compared to the historical notes and debates on ideologies, this newly discovered "Fourth Era" notebook was more likely to explain the original host's suicide.

The Fourth Era was the epoch preceding the current Black Iron Era, shrouded in mist and missing many details. Even the tombs, ancient cities, and documents from that period were scarce. Historians and archaeologists could only piece together a faint outline through the ambiguous theological texts of the Seven Churches, which were primarily faith-based education. They knew of the Solomon Empire, the Tudor Dynasty, and the T'lan C'thur Empire.

Cai Lian, determined to unravel the mist and restore history, had little interest in the "Third Era" or earlier, which leaned more towards mythology. His excitement was palpable.

"Well, upon closer inspection, the original host's concern for the interview and future employment was unnecessary..."

Universities were still relatively scarce, and the vast majority of students were nobility or wealthy children. While commoners faced discrimination and exclusion from social circles, they could still build valuable人脉 through group discussions and collective activities.

For example, Welch McGowan, son of a banker in Kingdonshire, Intershire, was known for his generosity. Due to their habit of working together on assignments and reports with Cai Lian and Naya, he often treated them.

With his mind wandering, Cai Lian continued reading the notes:

"June 18th: Graduation. Farewell, my Khoy University!"

"June 19th: I examined that notebook. Through structural and root comparisons, I determined it was a variant of Ancient Feysac. More precisely, Ancient Feysac had been subtly evolving for over a thousand years."

"June 20th: We deciphered the first page's content. The author belonged to a family named 'Antigonus'."

"June 21st: He mentioned the 'Black Emperor.' This contradicted the era deduced from the previous content. Could my professor be wrong? Was the 'Black Emperor' a title held by every emperor of the Solomon Empire?"

"June 22nd: The family named 'Antigonus' held significant status within the Solomon Empire. The notebook's owner mentioned engaging in a secret transaction with someone named Tudor. Tudor? Tudor Dynasty?"

"June 23rd: I forced myself not to think about that notebook, not to go to Welch's place. I must prepare for the interview! It's a very important matter!"

"June 24th: Naya told me they had new findings. I think I should go and see what they discovered."

"June 25th: Based on the newly deciphered content, the notebook's owner accepted a mission to travel to the summit of the 'Horachies' Mountains to visit the 'Land of Night' at its peak. My goddess, the summit of the Horachies Mountains exceeds six thousand meters—how could a country exist there? How do they survive?"

"June 26th: Are all these strange things real?"

The notebook ended there, and Zhou Mingrui had arrived on this world on the early morning of June 28th.

"So, the notes from June 27th must exist. It was probably that sentence... 'Everyone will die, including me...'"

Cai Lian turned to the first page he had seen, making a judgment that sent a chill down his spine.

To unravel the mystery of the original host's suicide, he should visit Welch and examine the ancient notebook. However, drawing from his experience in novels, films, and TV shows, he suspected that if he went, and if the matter was indeed connected, he would likely face unknown dangers—those who recklessly ventured into haunted castles served as a stark warning!

Yet, he could not avoid it. Avoidance would never solve the problem; it would only allow the issue to grow, accumulate, and eventually overwhelm him completely.

Should he call the authorities? He couldn't very well tell them he had committed suicide.

Knock! Knock knock!

A sharp, forceful knock echoed at the door.

Cai Lian sat upright, straining to listen.

Knock!

Knock knock!

The knocking reverberated through the empty, desolate hallway.

**Chapter 10: The Norm**

**"Who?"**

Carrick, the new tenant, found himself lost in thought, pondering the mysterious circumstances surrounding his predecessor's suicide and the potential dangers he might face in this strange new world. The sudden knock at the door jolted him from his reverie. Instinctively, he pulled out his desk drawer, retrieved the revolver hidden inside, and queried the visitor with wary caution.

Silence held outside for two seconds, then a slightly reedy voice, speaking in the Arawa dialect, called out:
**"I am, Montebarton, Beiche Montebarton."**

Pausing briefly, it added:
**"Police."**

Beiche Montebarton… The name lodging in his ears instantly recalled its owner—a rough, brutal man prone to violence, one of the constables patrolling the district. Yet, perhaps only such a fellow could intimidate the drunks, thieves, opportunistic pickpockets, ruffians, and villains who infested the streets. His distinctive, slightly harsh voice was one of his trademarks.

**"Right then, I'll be along directly!"** Carrick responded loudly, trying to mask his unease.

His original intention was to toss the revolver back into the drawer, but the reason for the unexpected police visit remained unknown, and a search couldn't be ruled out. He cautiously moved to the fireplace where the embers had long since died out, depositing the pistol inside.

Next, he took the small coal basket, sprinkled a few pieces of coal into the fireplace, covering the gun, then placed the teapot on top to conceal everything completely.

Having done this, he straightened his attire and briskly approached the door, opening it while mumbling indistinctly:
**"Apologies, I was merely taking a short nap."**

Four police officers stood outside, dressed in black uniforms with white squares, wearing badge caps. Beiche Montebarton, with his brown-yellow beard, cleared his throat and informed Carrick:
**"These three officers have some questions for you."**

Officer? Carrick reflexively glanced at the shoulder insignia of the other three. Two bore three silver pentagrams, while one bore two. Clearly, they outranked Beiche Montebarton, whose insignia consisted of only three chevrons. As a history student, Carrick knew little about police ranks, only that Beiche Montebarton often boasted about being a senior inspector.
So, were those three commissioners? Influenced by the remarks of his friends Benson and Welch, Carrick possessed some general knowledge. He stepped aside, gesturing towards the interior of the room:
**"Please, come in. What is it regarding?"**

The foremost of the three officers was a middle-aged man whose piercing gaze seemed capable of seeing through the soul, inspiring an unavoidable dread. Deep wrinkles marked his eyes, and a faint auburn hairline peeked from beneath the edge of his cap. He cast a proprietary eye over the room while voicing his question gravely:
**"Do you know Welch McGavin?"**

**"What of him?"** Carrick's heart gave a jolt, and the words escaped his lips involuntarily. The name resonated with the recent, unsettling events.

**"I am the one asking you,"** the stern middle-aged officer replied, his expression grim.

His companion, who also wore three stars on his shoulder, looked at Carrick and smiled mildly:
**"No need for anxiety, we are merely conducting routine inquiries."**

This officer was in his thirties, with a straight nose bridge, and his grey eyes possessed an indescribable depth, reminiscent of an unfrequented lake in an ancient forest. There was an unnerving stillness about him.

Carrick drew in a breath, steeling himself, before replying:
**"If you refer to Welch McGavin, a graduate of Khoy University from Constancia, then yes, I know him well. We were fellow students, disciples of the esteemed Senior Lecturer Quentin Cohen."**

In the Loen Kingdom, "Professor" was not merely a title but a position, akin to the fusion of a professor and department head on Earth. Essentially, one university department could have only one Professor; an Associate Professor could only aspire to the "full" rank upon their superior's retirement or by displacing them through merit.

To retain talent, after years of exploration, the Loen Kingdom Higher Education Council had incorporated the position of Senior Associate Professor into the lecturer, associate professor, professor hierarchy, granting it to academically distinguished or sufficiently experienced individuals who hadn't reached the rank of Professor.

Pausing to study the middle-aged officer's eyes, Carrick considered for a second before speaking:
**"Frankly, our relationship was quite good. Lately, Carrick, Welch, and Naya have been meeting frequently to interpret and discuss the 'Fourth Dynasty' manuscript he obtained – a notebook, Officer. What has happened to him?"**

The middle-aged officer did not answer immediately, but glanced sideways at his grey-eyed companion.

The grey-eyed officer, plain-faced but polite, responded gently:
**"I'm very sorry, Mr. McGavin has passed away."**

**"Passed away?"** Though there had been a faint, dreadful premonition, Carrick couldn't help but exclaim in astonishment, his hand instinctively tightening on the doorframe. Welch also met the same fate as his predecessor? This was truly terrifying!

**"What about Naya?"** Carrick hurriedly pressed, his voice tight with fear.

**"Miss Naya has also passed,"** the grey-eyed officer stated calmly. **"They were found dead within Mr. McGavin's residence."**

**"Murdered?"** Carrick guessed faintly, his mind racing. Perhaps suicide… the thought offered a terrifying sliver of comfort.

The grey-eyed officer shook his head slowly:
**"No, based on the traces at the scene, it appears they took their own lives. Mr. McGavin repeatedly rammed his head against the wall, staining it blood-red. Miss Naya drowned herself in a basin, the kind used for washing."**

**"Impossible…"** Carrick shuddered, picturing the bizarre, horrifying scene vividly in his mind. The girl kneeling before the chair, her face submerged in the water-filled basin, her brown hair flowing gently; Welch sprawled on the floor, his eyes fixed on the ceiling, his forehead obliterated, stained with gore, and the wall, a canvas of impact marks, dripping blood… A chill ran down his spine, and his hands trembled uncontrollably. *He was a history student, not a supernatural investigator, yet the scene felt like something from a forbidden tome.*

The grey-eyed officer's lips moved slightly:
**"We initially thought the same, but the autopsy results and the scene itself ruled out factors like drugs or external force. They, I mean Mr. McGavin and Miss Naya, showed no signs of resistance."**

Before Carrick could speak again, the officer entered the room, feigning casual curiosity as he asked:
**"When was the last time you saw either Mr. McGavin or Miss Naya?"**

He spoke while directing a glance towards his colleague with the two silver stars.
That was a young officer, seemingly of an age comparable to Carrick himself, with black hair, green eyes, and a pleasant countenance, possessing a certain romantic poetical aura.

At the question, Carrick's mind raced, searching for an answer. He needed to buy time, deflect suspicion, and perhaps subtly steer the investigation towards the supernatural, as that was his only defense against the unknown dangers hinted at by the original tenant's suicide and now this scene.
**"Probably June 26th,"** he replied carefully. **"We interpreted a new section of the manuscript together, after which I returned home to prepare for my interview on the 30th, the interview for the History Department at Khoy University."**

Khoy University… Tingen City, known as the City of Universities, housed Khoy and Tingen Universities, alongside technical schools, the Bar Institute, and business colleges, ranking second only to the capital Backlund.

As soon as he finished speaking, his peripheral vision caught the young officer walking over to his desk and picking up the "notebook," which resembled a diary more than anything else. *Damn!* He'd forgotten to hide it!

Carrick muttered sharply: **"You!"**

The young officer offered him a polite smile, but continued turning pages in the notebook. The grey-eyed officer explained:
**"This is standard procedure."**

At this point, Beiche Montebarton and the stern middle-aged officer merely stood by, observing without intervening or assisting in the search. Where was their warrant? Carrick frowned, realizing that the concept of a warrant as understood in the modern world might not exist here, especially with the police force being only fifteen or sixteen years old itself. In his predecessor's childhood, they were still called Inspectors. *This world's legal system was different, perhaps less formal, but no less dangerous.*

Unable to stop them, Carrick watched helplessly as the young officer quickly scanned through the "his" notebook, the grey-eyed officer posing no further questions.

**"What peculiar items were found?"** the young officer suddenly queried after flipping to the end. **"And what does this mean? 'All will die, including me'…"**

Is it not common knowledge that everyone, except the divine, will die? Carrick had initially prepared a partial lie, but then abruptly remembered his original intention to "connect" with the police, as a precaution against potential dangers, and the strange events surrounding his arrival. This was his chance. He needed to play the part of the disturbed, grieving victim.
In less than a second, he made his decision, covering his forehead with his hand and replying with apparent agony:
**"I don't know, I truly don't know… Upon waking this morning, I felt something was amiss, as if I had forgotten certain things, particularly events of the past few days, and even couldn't recall why I wrote such a statement."**

Sometimes, confession was indeed the best course of action, provided it was handled with skill. What to confess, what to omit, and the sequence of revelations were crucial considerations. As someone who had navigated dangerous situations, Carrick understood the importance of plausible deniability.

**"Preposterous! Do we look like fools to you?"** Beiche Montebarton interjected angrily, unable to contain himself any longer. His harsh voice grated on the thin air. This lie was too tawdry, it bordered on insulting their intelligence!

Better to pretend insanity than feign amnesia!
**"Yes,"** Carrick replied calmly, holding the gaze of Montebarton and the middle-aged officer. He met their stares evenly. This fabrication was undeniably convincing, a carefully constructed shield.

**"Perhaps it is possible,"** the grey-eyed officer remarked slowly, his grey eyes seeming to weigh the words carefully.

What? Already believing him? Carrick was taken aback by the speed of the acceptance.

The grey-eyed officer smiled faintly at him:
**"A specialist will be coming in a couple of days. Believe me, she should be able to help you recover your lost memories."**

A specialist? Help recover memories? Carrick frowned. *Psychological help? What if this specialist dredged up memories of my home planet?* The thought caused a sharp, unfamiliar pain, like a splinter in his mind. An unwelcome side effect of his carefully constructed lie.

The young officer put down the notebook, conducted a thorough search of the desk and room, fortunately focusing on the books and not inquiring about the teapot.
**"Well then, Mr. Carrick, thank you for your cooperation. For the next few days, you'd best remain in Tingen. If travel is absolutely necessary, notify Constable Montebarton. Otherwise, you will be considered a fugitive."** The grey-eyed officer concluded.

That was it? The questioning concluded for the day? No further questions, no additional investigation? Or would he be taken back for interrogation and perhaps worse? Carrick felt a knot of confusion and unease tighten in his stomach.

However, he also wished to resolve the unsettling incident involving Welch, so he nodded, forcing calmness into his voice:
**"Understood."**

The officers filed out of the room. The one at the rear suddenly clapped Carrick on the shoulder, a surprisingly firm gesture.
**"Well done, you're quite lucky."**

**"What?"** Carrick looked utterly bewildered.

The green-eyed officer with the poetical flair smiled enigmatically:
**"Generally speaking, the norm is for all involved in such an event to perish."**

**"We are glad, and quite fortunate, that you are still alive."**

With that, he exited the room, politely closing the door behind him.

The norm is for all involved to perish? Glad we found you alive? Quite fortunate you are still here?
In that June afternoon, a profound chill ran down Carrick's spine, deeper than the physical cold, settling in his bones. He was alone again, the unsettling events of the day replaying in his mind, the weight of the revolver still felt heavy in his pocket, a silent reminder of the dangerous world he now inhabited.
