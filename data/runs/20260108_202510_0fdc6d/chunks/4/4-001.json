  "draft": "\n**Chapter Title:** The 4th Chapter Divination\n\n**English Draft:**\n\nRe-seating himself, Zhou Mingrui waited until the distant church bell tolled seven times, the echoes fading slowly, before he rose leisurely and moved towards the cabinet, retrieving his attire.\n\nA black tailcoat, trousers cinching slightly at the ankles, and a low-crowned top hat completed the ensemble, lending him the semblance of Victorian drama. Gazing into the mirror, he saw not merely a reflection, but a stagehand preparing for a scene.\n\n\"A mere errand, nothing more... just procuring materials for a... divination ritual,\" he muttered softly, shaking his head with a wry smile. \"Clayen was so preoccupied with the impending interview that even his body adopted this habit, this sole respectable attire, whenever his focus wavered.\"\n\nExhaling, he removed the tailcoat and waistcoat, replacing them with an aged, tawny-colored overcoat and a matching felt top hat with a round brim. Adjusting himself, he approached the bunk bed, lifted the mattress, and reached through a discreet tear in the base, fingers probing until he found the hidden compartment.\n\nHis right hand withdrew clutching a roll of banknotes, roughly seven bills, their color a deep, almost translucent emerald green.\n\nThis was Benson's entire savings, the funds covering his sustenance for these three days. Only two five-Soli notes remained; the rest were one-Soli bills.\n\nWithin the monetary hierarchy of the Loen Kingdom, the Soli ranked second, originating from ancient silver coins, with twelve Pennies to a Soli. Denominations included the One-Soli and the Five-Soli notes.\n\nAt the apex sat the Gold Pound, a paper currency backed by gold, directly convertible. One Gold Pound equated to twenty Soli, available in One, Five, and Ten denominations.\n\nUnfurling the notes, a faint, peculiar scent of ink permeated the air—a scent tinged with the very essence of currency.\n\nPerhaps it was the lingering influence of Clayen’s fragmented memories, or perhaps it was the unchanging, deep-seated desire for wealth within himself, but in that moment, Zhou Mingrui found himself inexplicably enamored with these little notes.\n\nLook, the designs were exquisite, rendering the dour King George III, with his waxed handlebar mustache, almost endearing... Look, the watermark visible through the sunlight was tantalizing, the meticulously crafted anti-counterfeiting tags distinguishing it from its fraudulent counterparts with an undeniable grace!\n\nHe admired the notes for nearly half a minute, then extracted two One-Soli bills, rolling the remainder back up and returning them to the hidden pocket within the mattress.\n\nTidying the torn fabric around the hole, he neatly folded the two One-Soli notes and slipped them into the left breast pocket of his tawny overcoat, separating them from the Pennies tucked into his trouser pockets.\n\nPocketed the keys in his right pocket and slinging the deep brown paper bag over his shoulder, he strode towards the door.\n\nThump-thump, his footsteps quickened then slowed, finally ceasing.\n\nZhou Mingrui stood by the door, his brow furrowed unknowingly.\n\nThe unresolved mysteries surrounding Clayen’s suicide—would venturing out now invite some unforeseen \"misfortune\"?\n\nAfter a moment’s contemplation, he returned to the desk, pulled open a drawer, and retrieved the brass revolver, its gleaming surface a stark contrast to the shadows.\n\nThis was the only weapon he could think of, yet a potent one! Though he had never fired a shot in anger, merely drawing this pistol should suffice to intimidate.\n\nRunning his fingers over the cold metal cylinder, he stuffed the revolver into the pocket containing the banknotes, clenching the notes in his palm and pressing the grip firmly against his leg, concealing the gesture.\n\nA sense of security bloomed within him, yet a nagging doubt surfaced:\n\n\"Won't it discharge accidentally?\"\n\nRuminating, he quickly devised a solution. Drawing the pistol, he flicked the cylinder to the left, ensuring the chamber left vacant by Clayen’s \"suicide\" was now aligned for safety, then snapped it shut with a decisive click.\n\nThus, any misfire would be inert, utterly harmless.\n\nRe-pocketing the revolver, his left hand remained embedded in the coat, no longer free.\n\nHe adjusted his cap with his right hand and pushed open the door, stepping out with a resolute stride.\n\nThe corridor remained dimly lit even at midday, sunlight filtering through the end windows meagerly. Descending the stairs and stepping out of the apartment, he finally embraced the warmth and brightness.\n\nThough July approached, heralding summer, the climate in Tingren, a northern city of the Loen Kingdom, possessed unique characteristics. Even the highest recorded temperatures on this world rarely exceeded thirty degrees Celsius, a mere ninety degrees Fahrenheit. The morning air was cool, yet the streets bore signs of neglect—puddles mingled with litter, a common sight in Clayen’s memory, even in areas with sewers, owing to the sheer density and poverty of the inhabitants.\n\n\"Try our delicious pan-fried meat and fish!\" a流动摊贩 cried out.\n\n\"Fresh oysters, steaming hot, for just five Pennies a bowl in the morning!\"\n\n\"Crispy little buns, Mackerel soup with Cider Beer!\"\n\n\"Seashells, seashells, fresh from the tide!\"\n\n\"Fresh vegetables from the countryside farms, cheap and delicious!\"\n\n...\n\nVegetable sellers, fruit vendors, and food stalls hawked their wares, their voices a cacophony amidst the hurried pedestrians. Some paused, deliberating their choices; others grew impatient, waving them off, work yet to be secured today.\n\nZhou Mingrui navigated the chaotic street, his left hand gripping the revolver tightly, clutching the banknotes in his palm, his right hand steadying the felt hat, head slightly bowed, eyes scanning the ground as he weaved through the crowd.\n\nCrowded places bred thieves, especially in this district teeming with semi-employed laborers and hungry, exploited children.\n\nAs the crowd thinned, he straightened his posture, raised his head, and surveyed the street ahead.\n\nA street musician played his hurdy-gurdy nearby, the melody both melancholic and spirited.\n\nBeside him, ragged children, their faces蜡黄 from malnutrition, swayed to the rhythm, their bodies instinctively twisting in a self-invented dance, their faces alight with joy, as if they were little princes or angels.\n\nA woman with a dour visage passed by, her skirt soiled, skin dull. Her eyes were vacant, yet a flicker of recognition sparked when she glanced at the children, perhaps seeing a shadow of her own thirty years prior.\n\nZhou Mingrui passed her, turning down another street, stopping before \"Slin's Bakery.\"\n\nThe owner, Mrs. Wendyslin, a septuagenarian with entirely gray hair, always wore a gentle smile. Since Clayen’s earliest memories, she had been selling bread and pastries here.\n\nHmm, her Tingren biscuits and lemon cakes were simply divine... Zhou Mingrui swallowed, smiling.\n\n\"Mrs. Slin, please, sixteen Black Rye loaves.\"\n\n\"Oh, little Clayen, where’s Benson? Not back yet?\" Mrs. Slin asked, her eyes crinkling with amusement.\n\n\"Still a few days,\" Zhou Mingrui answered vaguely.\n\nMrs. Slin, meanwhile, was portioning out the bread, her tone tinged with nostalgia.\n\n\"He’s such a diligent lad, he’ll find a good wife yet.\" A playful curve touched her lips.\n\n\"Now it’s you, you’ve graduated. Our esteemed History graduate from Khoy University~ You’ll soon be earning your keep. You shouldn’t live in such a run-down apartment; at the very least, you need your own washroom.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Slin, you look remarkably young and vibrant today,\" Zhou Mingrui managed a nervous chuckle.\n\nIf Clayen secured the position as a Lecturer at Tingren University, their family’s fortunes would indeed improve! In his fragmented memories, he had even fantasized about renting a standalone house in the suburbs, complete with five or six rooms upstairs, two washrooms, a large balcony, two rooms downstairs, a dining room, a living room, a kitchen, another washroom, and a basement storage.\n\nNot an impossible dream; even an intern Lecturer at Tingren University earned a weekly salary of two Gold Pounds, rising to three Gold Pounds and ten Soli upon confirmation. Knowing that his brother, Benson, with years of service, earned a mere one Pound and ten Soli weekly, while factory laborers often scraped by on less than one Pound, Zhou Mingrui calculated the cost of such a house, ranging from nineteen Soli to one Pound and eighteen Soli per month in rent.\n\n\"It’s the difference between earning three thousand Soli monthly and fourteen thousand five hundred...\" he mused under his breath.\n\nYet, all this hinged on passing the interview at either Tingren or Backlund University.\n\nOther avenues? Without connections, one couldn't secure a recommendation for public service, and historians faced even narrower job prospects, with private advisors for nobles or industrial magnates being a rare commodity.\n\nConsidering that Clayen’s knowledge was fragmented, incomplete, riddled with gaps, Zhou Mingrui felt a wave of awkwardness and unease regarding Mrs. Slin’s hopeful words.\n\n\"No, I’ve always been young at heart,\" Mrs. Slin quipped, handing him the measured sixteen Black Rye loaves in his own brown paper bag.\n\n\"Nine Pennies,\" she held out her right hand.\n\nEach loaf weighed approximately half a Pound, with inevitable variance.\n\n\"Nine Pennies? That’s less than the two days ago, wasn’t it eleven?\" Zhou Mingrui asked reflexively.\n\nAnd just last month, it was fifteen Pennies.\n\n\"The repeal of the 'Grain Act' and the demonstrations thanking those who protested,\" Mrs. Slin gestured expansively with both hands, a knowing smile playing on her lips.\n\nZhou Mingrui nodded vaguely, his memories of the 'Grain Act' fragmented, recalling only that its core was protecting domestic agricultural prices, preventing the import of grain from southern nations like Fenwport, Masque, and Lembourg until prices reached a certain threshold.\n\nWhy would people protest such a measure?\n\nHe didn't dwell on it, mindful of the revolver in his pocket. Carefully extracting banknotes, he produced a One-Soli bill and offered it to Mrs. Slin.\n\nReceiving three Pennies in change, he slipped them into his trouser pocket before heading towards the \"Lettuce and Meat Market\" down the street, endeavoring to fulfill his sister Melissa’s request for lamb stew with tender peas.\n\nAt the junction of Iron Cross Street and the Crocuses Street lay the Town Square, now bustling with activity as numerous tents had been erected. A bizarrely dressed clown, distributing pamphlets, caught his eye.\n\n\"Tomorrow evening, Circus performance?\" Zhou Mingrui glanced at the pamphlet, whispering its contents.\n\nMelissa would adore it. What was the cost of admission? The thought crossed his mind as he approached.\n\nHe was about to inquire of the clown in his red-and-yellow attire when a raspy female voice spoke from his side:\n\n\"Desire divination?\"\n\nTwisting his head instinctively, Zhou Mingrui saw a woman standing before a low tent, her head covered by a pointed hat, dressed in a black gown, her face daubed with red and yellow theatrical makeup, her eyes a deep, grayish-blue.\n\n\"No,\" he shook his head, lacking the means for such frivolity.\n\nThe woman smiled enigmatically.\n\n\"My Tarot divination is remarkably accurate.\"\n\n\"Tarot...\" Zhou Mingrui froze.\n\nThe pronunciation bore a striking resemblance to the Tarot cards from his own world!\n\nAnd in his world, Tarot was a form of fortune-telling using playing cards, augmented with symbolic 'picture cards'.\n\nWait... a sudden recollection struck him. The origin of Tarot divination in this world was not from the Seven orthodox deities, nor ancient relics, but was invented over one hundred seventy years prior by Rosier Gustav, then the Head of State of the Intish Republic.\n\nThis Rosier gentleman had invented the steam engine, improved sailing ships, overthrown the Intish Kingdom's monarchy, and gained the recognition of the 'God of Artisans' church, becoming the first Head of State of the new republic.\n\nHe went on to conquer territories, incorporating nations like Lembourg into the Intish sphere, compelling powers like the Loen Kingdom, Fenwport, and Fasack Empire to submit. He later reorganized the republic into an empire, styling himself 'Caesar'.\n\nIt was during Rosier's reign that the church received its first public Revelation since the Fifth Century, leading to the title 'God of Steam and Machinery'. Rosier also invented Tarot divination, establishing the current composition and gameplay of the cards, including familiar games like Whist, Patience, Texas Hold'em, and Quart... \n\nFurthermore, he dispatched fleets to discover routes to the southern continent through storms and chaotic currents, initiating the era of colonization.\n\nAlas, his later years were marred by betrayal, culminating in his assassination by the Eternal Sun Church, the Solon family (the ruling dynasty of Intish), and other nobles in the year 1198 of the Fifth Century, dying in the White Maple Palace.\n\nThis recollection brought a peculiar ache to Zhou Mingrui’s teeth.\n\nCould this woman be a fellow traveler from another world?\n\nWith this thought, he resolved to examine the Tarot cards here. He nodded towards the woman, the one with the painted face.\n\n\"If the price is reasonable, I shall give it a try,\" he said, his voice hesitant.\n\nThe woman beamed, \"Sir, you are the first visitor today. It shall be free.\"",
  "back_translation": "\n**第四章 占卜**\n\n周明锐重新坐下，等到远处教堂的钟声敲响七下，余音缓缓消散，才懒洋洋地起身，走向柜子，取出自己的衣服。\n\n一件黑色燕尾服，一条在脚踝处微微收紧的长裤，以及一顶低檐圆顶礼帽，让他看起来像是维多利亚时代的戏剧演员。他凝视着镜中的自己，看到的不仅仅是一面镜子，更像是一位准备上场的舞台工作人员。\n\n“只是个小差事……仅此而已……只是在准备……占卜仪式的材料。”他低声自语，嘴角带着一丝苦涩的微笑，摇了摇头。“克莱恩太过专注于即将到来的面试，以至于连他的身体都养成了这个习惯，每当他心神不宁时，就会穿上这件唯一体面的行头。”\n\n他呼出一口气，脱下燕尾服和马甲，换上一件深棕色的旧外套和一顶圆檐毡礼帽。整理好自己，他走向上下铺，掀开床垫，伸手穿过床板上一个隐蔽的破洞，手指摸索着，直到找到那个隐藏的暗格。\n\n他的右手伸进去，抓出一卷钞票，大约七张，颜色深得近乎半透明的翠绿色。\n\n这是本森的全部积蓄，足够他支撑这三天的生活。只剩下两张五索利的钞票；其余的都是索利纸币。\n\n在洛恩王国的货币体系中，索利是第二位的货币，源自古老的银币，一索利等于十二便士。面额包括一索利和五索利纸币。\n\n而最高位的则是金磅，一种以黄金为后盾的纸币，可以直接兑换。一金磅等于二十索利，面额有壹金磅、伍金磅和拾金磅。\n\n他展开钞票，一股淡淡的、奇特的墨水味弥漫在空气中——一种带着货币本身气息的味道。\n\n或许是克莱恩破碎记忆的残留影响，又或许是自己内心深处、从未改变的对财富的渴望，但在那一刻，周明锐莫名地对这些小小的纸片产生了兴趣。\n\n看，图案精美，就连那个留着油光大胡子的乔治三世国王，看起来都几乎可爱起来……看，阳光透过的水印如此诱人，那些精心设计的防伪标记，与那些伪造品相比，带着不容置疑的优雅！\n\n他凝视着这些钞票，将近半分钟之久，然后抽出两张一索利的钞票，将剩下的卷好，放回床垫暗格。\n\n他整理好破洞周围的布料，将那两张一索利的钞票仔细折好，塞进深棕色外套的左胸前口袋，与塞在裤袋里的便士分开。\n\n将钥匙揣进右裤袋，将深棕色纸袋甩到肩上，他大步走向门口。\n\n咚咚，他的脚步先快后慢，最后停了下来。\n\n周明锐站在门口，不知不觉间，眉头紧锁。\n\n克莱恩自杀的未解之谜——现在出门，会不会招来什么意想不到的“不幸”？\n\n思索片刻后，他回到书桌前，拉开抽屉，取出那把黄铜制的左轮手枪，枪身闪着冷光，与周围的阴影形成鲜明对比。\n\n这是他能想到的唯一武器，却是一把威力强大的武器！虽然他从未在实战中开过枪，但仅仅是拔出这把左轮，应该足以震慑对方。\n\n他手指抚过冰冷的枪管，将手枪塞进装有钞票的口袋，将钞票攥在手心，枪柄紧紧抵在大腿上，隐藏了自己的动作。\n\n一种安全感在他心中绽放，但一个挥之不去的疑虑浮现出来：\n\n“会不会走火？”\n\n他沉思片刻，迅速想出了一个解决方案。他拔出左轮，向左旋转弹巢，确保克莱恩“自杀”时留下的空膛现在处于安全位置，然后果断地“咔哒”一声合上。\n\n这样，任何走火都不会造成伤害，完全无害。\n\n将手枪重新放回口袋，他的左手依旧插在衣服里，不再空闲。\n\n他用右手调整了一下帽子，推开房门，大步走了出去。\n\n走廊即使在正午时分也依旧昏暗，阳光透过尽头的窗户，吝啬地洒进来。走下楼梯，走出公寓，他终于拥抱到了温暖和光明。\n\n虽然七月临近，夏天已经到来，但帝伦城作为洛恩王国北部的一座城市，有着独特的气候特点。即使在这个世界有记录以来的最高气温，也从未超过三十摄氏度，换算成华氏也只有九十度左右。清晨的空气凉爽，但街道上却显露出一种被忽视的景象——水洼与垃圾混杂，这是克莱恩记忆中常见的画面，即使在有下水道的区域，也因为居民的极度密集和贫困而难以清理。\n\n“尝尝我们美味的煎肉煎鱼吧！”一个流动摊贩大声叫卖。\n\n“新鲜牡蛎，热气腾腾，早上一碗只要五便士！”\n\n“酥脆的小包子，搭配麦酒炖鲭鱼！”\n\n“海贝壳，海贝壳，刚从潮水中捡到的！”\n\n“来自乡下农场的新鲜蔬菜，便宜又好吃！”\n\n……\n\n菜贩、果贩和小吃摊贩们叫卖着他们的商品，声音在匆忙的行人中汇成一片嘈杂。有些人停下脚步，犹豫着选择；还有些人则显得不耐烦，挥手示意他们走开，今天还没找到工作。\n\n周明锐在混乱的街道上穿行，左手紧紧抓着左轮手枪，右手稳稳地扶着毡礼帽，微微低着头，眼睛扫视着地面，穿梭在人群中。\n\n人多的地方容易滋生小偷，尤其是在这个充斥着半雇佣工和饥饿被剥削儿童的街区。\n\n随着人群逐渐稀疏，他挺直了身体，抬起头，打量着前方的街道。\n\n不远处，一个街头乐师在演奏手摇风琴，旋律既忧伤又充满活力。\n\n旁边，几个衣衫褴褛的孩子，因为营养不良面色蜡黄，随着乐声摇摆，身体本能地扭动着，跳着自创的舞蹈，脸上洋溢着快乐，仿佛他们是小王子或天使。\n\n一个面色阴沉的女人从他们身边走过，裙子沾着污渍，皮肤暗淡无光。她的眼睛空洞，但当她瞥见那些孩子时，眼中闪过一丝认出的光芒，或许看到了三十年前的自己。\n\n周明锐从她身边经过，拐进另一条街，在“斯林面包店”前停下。\n\n店主温迪斯林夫人，一位七十多岁的老妇人，头发全白，总是带着温和的笑容。从克莱恩最早的记忆开始，她就在这里卖面包和糕点。\n\n嗯，她的帝伦饼干和柠檬蛋糕真是美味绝伦……周明锐咽了咽口水，笑了笑。\n\n“斯林夫人，请给我十六个黑麦面包。”\n\n“哦，小克莱恩，本森呢？还没回来吗？”斯林夫人笑着问，眼中带着笑意。\n\n“还有几天。”周明锐含糊地回答。\n\n与此同时，斯林夫人正在分装面包，语气中带着一丝怀旧。\n\n“他是个很勤奋的孩子，以后会找到好妻子的。”她的嘴角带着一丝俏皮的弧度。\n\n“现在轮到你了，你毕业了。我们尊敬的科霍大学历史系毕业生~你很快就能自食其力了。你不该住在这种破旧的公寓里；至少你需要一个独立的卫生间。”\n\n“斯林夫人，您今天看起来年轻又有活力。”周明锐勉强挤出一丝紧张的笑声。\n\n如果克莱恩能在帝伦大学或巴克兰德大学找到教职，他们家的确会改善很多！在那些破碎的记忆中，他甚至幻想过租住在郊区的独立屋子里，楼上五六个房间，两个卫生间，一个大阳台，楼下两个房间，一个餐厅，一个客厅，一个厨房，另一个卫生间，还有一个地下室储藏室。\n\n这并非不可能的梦；即使是帝伦大学的实习讲师，每周也有两金磅的薪水，确认后会涨到三金磅十索利。知道自己的哥哥本森，工作多年，每周也只有十磅十索利，而工厂工人往往连一磅都难以糊口，周明锐计算了一下，这样的房子租金从十九索利到一磅十八索利不等。\n\n“每月三千索利和一万四千五百索利之间的差距……”他低声自语。\n\n然而，这一切都取决于能否通过帝伦或巴克兰德大学的面试。\n\n还有其他途径吗？没有关系，就无法获得公共服务的推荐，而历史学家的工作前景甚至更加狭窄，只有贵族或工业大亨的私人顾问才是稀罕物。\n\n考虑到克莱恩的知识是破碎的、不完整的、充满缺口，周明锐对斯林夫人充满希望的话语感到一阵尴尬和不安。\n\n“不，我一直都很年轻。”斯林夫人打趣道，将他量好的十六个黑麦面包递给他，用他的棕色纸袋装好。\n\n“九便士。”她伸出右手。\n\n每个面包大约重半磅，难免会有差异。\n\n“九便士？比两天前便宜了，不是十一便士吗？”周明锐下意识地问道。\n\n而就在上个月，还是十五便士。\n\n“《谷物法》的废除和感谢那些抗议者的示威游行。”斯林夫人双手大幅度地比划着，嘴角带着了然的微笑。\n\n周明锐含糊地点了点头，他对《谷物法》的记忆也是破碎的，只记得它的核心是保护国内农业价格，阻止从芬波特、莫克和卢森堡等南方国家进口粮食，直到价格达到某个阈值。\n\n人们为什么要抗议这样的措施呢？\n\n他没有深思，只是注意到了口袋里的左轮手枪。他小心地抽出钞票，拿出一张一索利的钞票递给斯林夫人。\n\n收到三枚便士作为找零，他将它们塞进口袋，然后走向街角的“生菜肉市场”，努力去实现妹妹梅丽莎点的羊肉豌豆炖锅的菜。\n\n铁十字街与郁金香街的交汇处是镇中心广场，现在因为搭起了许多帐篷而热闹非凡。一个穿着古怪的马戏团小丑，正在分发传单，吸引了他的注意。\n\n“明天晚上，马戏团表演？”周明锐瞥了一眼传单，低声念着上面的内容。\n\n梅丽莎会喜欢的。入场费是多少？这个念头在他走近时闪过。\n\n他正要询问那个穿着红黄条纹服装的小丑，这时一个沙哑的女声从旁边传来：\n\n“想要占卜吗？”\n\n周明锐本能地扭过头，看到一个女人站在一个低矮的帐篷前，头上戴着尖顶帽，穿着黑色长裙，脸上涂着红黄相间的戏剧妆容，眼睛是深灰蓝色的。\n\n“不，”他摇了摇头，没有这种消遣的闲钱。\n\n女人神秘地笑了笑。\n\n“我的塔罗占卜非常准确。”\n\n“塔罗……”周明锐愣住了。\n\n这个发音与他原来世界里的塔罗牌如此相似！\n\n而在他的世界里，塔罗是一种使用扑克牌进行占卜的方式，辅以象征性的“图画牌”。\n\n等等……一个突然的回忆击中了他。在这个世界里，塔罗占卜的起源并非来自七位正统神祇，也不是古代遗物，而是由罗西尔·古斯塔夫在一百七十年前发明的，当时他是茵蒂斯共和国的国家元首。\n\n这位罗西尔先生发明了蒸汽机，改进了帆船，推翻了茵蒂斯王国的君主制，获得了“工匠之神”教会的认可，成为新共和国的第一任元首。\n\n他继续征服领土，将卢森等国家纳入茵蒂斯的势力范围，迫使洛恩王国、芬波特和法萨克帝国等国臣服。后来，他将共和国改组为帝国，自封为“凯撒”。\n\n正是在罗西尔的统治下，教会收到了自五世纪以来的第一份公开启示，因此得名“蒸汽与机械之神”。罗西尔还发明了塔罗占卜，确立了塔罗牌的现有组成和玩法，包括惠斯脱、纸牌游戏、德州扑克、四人牌等……\n\n此外，他还派遣舰队通过风暴和混乱洋流开辟通往南方大陆的航线，开启了殖民时代。\n\n可惜的是，他晚年的岁月被背叛玷污，最终在公元1198年（五世纪）被永恒太阳教会、索伦家族（茵蒂斯统治王朝）和其他贵族联手刺杀，在白杨宫中死去。\n\n这个回忆让周明锐的牙齿感到一阵奇特的刺痛。\n\n这个女人，会是来自另一个世界的同行吗？\n\n想到这里，他决定在这里看看塔罗牌。他朝那个画着妆的女人点了点头。\n\n“如果价格合理，我愿意试试。”他说道，声音有些犹豫。\n\n女人脸上绽放出笑容，“先生，您是今天的第一位客人。免费。”",

  "final_translation": "\n**Chapter Title:** The 4th Chapter Divination\n\n**English Draft:**\n\nRe-seating himself, Zhou Mingrui waited until the distant church bell tolled seven times, the echoes fading slowly, before he rose leisurely and moved towards the cabinet, retrieving his attire.\n\nA black tailcoat, trousers cinching slightly at the ankles, and a low-crowned top hat completed the ensemble, lending him the semblance of Victorian drama. Gazing into the mirror, he saw not merely a reflection, but a stagehand preparing for a scene.\n\n\"A mere errand, nothing more... just procuring materials for a... divination ritual,\" he muttered softly, shaking his head with a wry smile. \"Clayen was so preoccupied with the impending interview that even his body adopted this habit, this sole respectable attire, whenever his focus wavered.\"\n\nExhaling, he removed the tailcoat and waistcoat, replacing them with an aged, tawny-colored overcoat and a matching felt top hat with a round brim. Adjusting himself, he approached the bunk bed, lifted the mattress, and reached through a discreet tear in the base, fingers probing until he found the hidden compartment.\n\nHis right hand withdrew clutching a roll of banknotes, roughly seven bills, their color a deep, almost translucent emerald green.\n\nThis was Benson's entire savings, the funds covering his sustenance for these three days. Only two five-Soli notes remained; the rest were one-Soli bills.\n\nWithin the monetary hierarchy of the Loen Kingdom, the Soli ranked second, originating from ancient silver coins, with twelve Pennies to a Soli. Denominations included the One-Soli and the Five-Soli notes.\n\nAt the apex sat the Gold Pound, a paper currency backed by gold, directly convertible. One Gold Pound equated to twenty Soli, available in One, Five, and Ten denominations.\n\nUnfurling the notes, a faint, peculiar scent of ink permeated the air—a scent tinged with the very essence of currency.\n\nPerhaps it was the lingering influence of Clayen’s fragmented memories, or perhaps it was the unchanging, deep-seated desire for wealth within himself, but in that moment, Zhou Mingrui found himself inexplicably enamored with these little notes.\n\nLook, the designs were exquisite, rendering the dour King George III, with his waxed handlebar mustache, almost endearing... Look, the watermark visible through the sunlight was tantalizing, the meticulously crafted anti-counterfeiting tags distinguishing it from its fraudulent counterparts with an undeniable grace!\n\nHe admired the notes for nearly half a minute, then extracted two One-Soli bills, rolling the remainder back up and returning them to the hidden pocket within the mattress.\n\nTidying the torn fabric around the hole, he neatly folded the two One-Soli notes and slipped them into the left breast pocket of his tawny overcoat, separating them from the Pennies tucked into his trouser pockets.\n\nPocketed the keys in his right pocket and slinging the deep brown paper bag over his shoulder, he strode towards the door.\n\nThump-thump, his footsteps quickened then slowed, finally ceasing.\n\nZhou Mingrui stood by the door, his brow furrowed unknowingly.\n\nThe unresolved mysteries surrounding Clayen’s suicide—would venturing out now invite some unforeseen \"misfortune\"?\n\nAfter a moment’s contemplation, he returned to the desk, pulled open a drawer, and retrieved the brass revolver, its gleaming surface a stark contrast to the shadows.\n\nThis was the only weapon he could think of, yet a potent one! Though he had never fired a shot in anger, merely drawing this pistol should suffice to intimidate.\n\nRunning his fingers over the cold metal cylinder, he stuffed the revolver into the pocket containing the banknotes, clenching the notes in his palm and pressing the grip firmly against his leg, concealing the gesture.\n\nA sense of security bloomed within him, yet a nagging doubt surfaced:\n\n\"Won't it discharge accidentally?\"\n\nRuminating, he quickly devised a solution. Drawing the pistol, he flicked the cylinder to the left, ensuring the chamber left vacant by Clayen’s \"suicide\" was now aligned for safety, then snapped it shut with a decisive click.\n\nThus, any misfire would be inert, utterly harmless.\n\nRe-pocketing the revolver, his left hand remained embedded in the coat, no longer free.\n\nHe adjusted his cap with his right hand and pushed open the door, stepping out with a resolute stride.\n\nThe corridor remained dimly lit even at midday, sunlight filtering through the end windows meagerly. Descending the stairs and stepping out of the apartment, he finally embraced the warmth and brightness.\n\nThough July approached, heralding summer, the climate in Tingren, a northern city of the Loen Kingdom, possessed unique characteristics. Even the highest recorded temperatures on this world rarely exceeded thirty degrees Celsius, a mere ninety degrees Fahrenheit. The morning air was cool, yet the streets bore signs of neglect—puddles mingled with litter, a common sight in Clayen’s memory, even in areas with sewers, owing to the sheer density and poverty of the inhabitants.\n\n\"Try our delicious pan-fried meat and fish!\" a流动摊贩 cried out.\n\n\"Fresh oysters, steaming hot, for just five Pennies a bowl in the morning!\"\n\n\"Crispy little buns, Mackerel soup with Cider Beer!\"\n\n\"Seashells, seashells, fresh from the tide!\"\n\n\"Fresh vegetables from the countryside farms, cheap and delicious!\"\n\n...\n\nVegetable sellers, fruit vendors, and food stalls hawked their wares, their voices a cacophony amidst the hurried pedestrians. Some paused, deliberating their choices; others grew impatient, waving them off, work yet to be secured today.\n\nZhou Mingrui navigated the chaotic street, his left hand gripping the revolver tightly, clutching the banknotes in his palm, his right hand steadying the felt hat, head slightly bowed, eyes scanning the ground as he weaved through the crowd.\n\nCrowded places bred thieves, especially in this district teeming with semi-employed laborers and hungry, exploited children.\n\nAs the crowd thinned, he straightened his posture, raised his head, and surveyed the street ahead.\n\nA street musician played his hurdy-gurdy nearby, the melody both melancholic and spirited.\n\nBeside him, ragged children, their faces蜡黄 from malnutrition, swayed to the rhythm, their bodies instinctively twisting in a self-invented dance, their faces alight with joy, as if they were little princes or angels.\n\nA woman with a dour visage passed by, her skirt soiled, skin dull. Her eyes were vacant, yet a flicker of recognition sparked when she glanced at the children, perhaps seeing a shadow of her own thirty years prior.\n\nZhou Mingrui passed her, turning down another street, stopping before \"Slin's Bakery.\"\n\nThe owner, Mrs. Wendyslin, a septuagenarian with entirely gray hair, always wore a gentle smile. Since Clayen’s earliest memories, she had been selling bread and pastries here.\n\nHmm, her Tingren biscuits and lemon cakes were simply divine... Zhou Mingrui swallowed, smiling.\n\n\"Mrs. Slin, please, sixteen Black Rye loaves.\"\n\n\"Oh, little Clayen, where’s Benson? Not back yet?\" Mrs. Slin asked, her eyes crinkling with amusement.\n\n\"Still a few days,\" Zhou Mingrui answered vaguely.\n\nMrs. Slin, meanwhile, was portioning out the bread, her tone tinged with nostalgia.\n\n\"He’s such a diligent lad, he’ll find a good wife yet.\" A playful curve touched her lips.\n\n\"Now it’s you, you’ve graduated. Our esteemed History graduate from Khoy University~ You’ll soon be earning your keep. You shouldn’t live in such a run-down apartment; at the very least, you need your own washroom.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Slin, you look remarkably young and vibrant today,\" Zhou Mingrui managed a nervous chuckle.\n\nIf Clayen secured the position as a Lecturer at Tingren University, their family’s fortunes would indeed improve! In his fragmented memories, he had even fantasized about renting a standalone house in the suburbs, complete with five or six rooms upstairs, two washrooms, a large balcony, two rooms downstairs, a dining room, a living room, a kitchen, another washroom, and a basement storage.\n\nNot an impossible dream; even an intern Lecturer at Tingren University earned a weekly salary of two Gold Pounds, rising to three Gold Pounds and ten Soli upon confirmation. Knowing that his brother, Benson, with years of service, earned a mere one Pound and ten Soli weekly, while factory laborers often scraped by on less than one Pound, Zhou Mingrui calculated the cost of such a house, ranging from nineteen Soli to one Pound and eighteen Soli per month in rent.\n\n\"It’s the difference between earning three thousand Soli monthly and fourteen thousand five hundred...\" he mused under his breath.\n\nYet, all this hinged on passing the interview at either Tingren or Backlund University.\n\nOther avenues? Without connections, one couldn't secure a Pathway into public service, and historians faced even narrower job prospects, with private advisors for nobles or industrial magnates being a rare commodity.\n\nConsidering that Clayen’s knowledge was fragmented, incomplete, riddled with gaps, Zhou Mingrui felt a wave of awkwardness and unease regarding Mrs. Slin’s hopeful words.\n\n\"No, I’ve always been young at heart,\" Mrs. Slin quipped, handing him the measured sixteen Black Rye loaves in his own brown paper bag.\n\n\"Nine Pennies,\" she held out her right hand.\n\nEach loaf weighed approximately half a Pound, with inevitable variance.\n\n\"Nine Pennies? That’s less than the two days ago, wasn't it eleven?\" Zhou Mingrui asked reflexively.\n\nAnd just last month, it was fifteen Pennies.\n\n\"The repeal of the 'Grain Act' and the demonstrations thanking those who protested,\" Mrs. Slin gestured expansively with both hands, a knowing smile playing on her lips.\n\nZhou Mingrui nodded vaguely, his memories of the 'Grain Act' fragmented, recalling only that its core was protecting domestic agricultural prices, preventing the import of grain from southern nations like Fenwport, Masque, and Luxembourg until prices reached a certain threshold.\n\nWhy would people protest such a measure?\n\nHe didn't dwell on it, mindful of the revolver in his pocket. Carefully extracting banknotes, he produced a One-Soli bill and offered it to Mrs. Slin.\n\nReceiving three Pennies in change, he slipped them into his trouser pocket before heading towards the \"Lettuce and Meat Market\" down the street, endeavoring to fulfill his sister Melissa’s request for lamb stew with tender peas.\n\nAt the junction of Iron Cross Street and the Crocuses Street lay the Town Square, now bustling with activity as numerous tents had been erected. A bizarrely dressed clown, distributing pamphlets, caught his eye.\n\n\"Tomorrow evening, Circus performance?\" Zhou Mingrui glanced at the pamphlet, whispering its contents.\n\nMelissa would adore it. What was the cost of admission? The thought crossed his mind as he approached.\n\nHe was about to inquire of the clown in his red-and-yellow attire when a raspy female voice spoke from his side:\n\n\"Desire divination?\"\n\nTwisting his head instinctively, Zhou Mingrui saw a woman standing before a low tent, her head covered by a pointed hat, dressed in a black gown, her face daubed with red and yellow theatrical makeup, her eyes a deep, grayish-blue.\n\n\"No,\" he shook his head, lacking the means for such frivolity.\n\nThe woman smiled enigmatically.\n\n\"My Tarot divination is remarkably accurate.\"\n\n\"Tarot...\" Zhou Mingrui froze.\n\nThe pronunciation bore a striking resemblance to the Tarot cards from his own world!\n\nAnd in his world, Tarot was a form of fortune-telling using playing cards, augmented with symbolic 'picture cards'.\n\nWait... a sudden recollection struck him. The origin of Tarot divination in this world was not from the Seven orthodox deities, nor ancient relics, but was invented over one hundred seventy years prior by Rosier Gustav, then the Head of State of the Intish Republic.\n\nThis Rosier gentleman had invented the steam engine, improved sailing ships, overthrown the Intish Kingdom's monarchy, and gained the recognition of the 'God of Artisans' church, becoming the first Head of State of the new republic.\n\nHe went on to conquer territories, incorporating nations like Luxembourg into the Intish sphere, compelling powers like the Loen Kingdom, Fenwport, and Fasack Empire to submit. He later reorganized the republic into an empire, styling himself 'Caesar'.\n\nIt was during Rosier's reign that the church received its first public Revelation since the Fifth Century, leading to the title 'God of Steam and Machinery'. Rosier also invented Tarot divination, establishing the current composition and gameplay of the cards, including familiar games like Whist, Patience, Texas Hold'em, and Quart...\n\nFurthermore, he dispatched fleets to discover routes to the southern continent through storms and chaotic currents, initiating the era of colonization.\n\nAlas, his later years were marred by betrayal, culminating in his assassination by the Eternal Sun Church, the Solon family (the ruling dynasty of Intish), and other nobles in the year 1198 of the Fifth Century, dying in the White Maple Palace.\n\nThis recollection brought a peculiar ache to Zhou Mingrui’s teeth.\n\nCould this woman be a fellow traveler from another world?\n\nWith this thought, he resolved to examine the Tarot cards here. He nodded towards the woman, the one with the painted face.\n\n\"If the price is reasonable, I shall give it a try,\" he said, his voice hesitant.\n\nThe woman beamed, \"Sir, you are the first visitor today. It shall be free.\"",
