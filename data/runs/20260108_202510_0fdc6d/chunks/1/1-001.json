  "draft": "\n**Chapter Title:** Crimson\n\n**Content:**\n\nPain!\nSuch pain!\nMy head aches terribly!\nThe bizarre dreams, thick with whispers, shattered rapidly. As Zhou Mingrui lay in slumber, his mind felt disjointed, as if struck by a blunt object, no, more like a sharp instrument piercing his temples, accompanied by a nauseating stirring!\n\nHissing... groggily, Zhou Mingrui tried to turn, tried to clutch his head, tried to sit up, but his limbs felt utterly unresponsive, as if his body had lost control.\n\nIt seems I am not fully awake yet, still trapped in a dream... I’ve heard tell of those who mistake the edge of sleep for the peak of consciousness... Zhou Mingrui, no stranger to such occurrences, strained his will, desperate to break free from the shackles of darkness and illusion.\n\nYet, in this liminal state, his will felt as ethereal as mist, elusive and hard to grasp. Despite his efforts, his thoughts scattered, his mind clouded with stray thoughts.\n\nWhat in the blazes? Why this sudden, agonizing headache in the dead of night?\n\nCould it be... a cerebral hemorrhage? A stroke?  \nOh, blast it, am I about to meet my end prematurely?\n\nWake up! Wake up now!\n\nHmm, it seems the pain has lessened slightly? But my head feels as if a dull blade is slowly carving its way through...  \nEnough of this. I cannot sleep anymore. How can I face the day?\n\nThinking of work... what good is work when I have this infernal headache? Of course, I’ll take the day off! No need to fear Boss Luo’s endless harangues!  \nAye, it’s not so bad, after all. A stolen half-day of respite!\n\nEach jarring throb accumulated a phantom strength, until finally, Zhou Mingrui summoned his resolve, stiffened his spine, and opened his eyes, fully breaking free from the half-sleep.\n\nHis vision swam first, then blurred with a faint crimson hue. Focusing, he saw a plain wooden desk before him, a single notebook lying open in the center. The paper was rough and yellowed, the top page written in strange letters, the ink a deep, almost dripping black.\n\nTo the left of the notebook, near the desk edge, sat a neat stack of books, perhaps seven or eight volumes. To their right, the wall was adorned with grey-white pipes and a wall lamp connected to them—a fixture of Western classical design, roughly the size of a man’s head, with a transparent inner glass and a black metal grille surrounding it.\n\nBelow the lamp’s extinguished glow, a bottle of ink sat, its surface faintly aglow with a pale crimson light, the raised embossing forming indistinct angelic patterns.\n\nBefore the ink bottle, on the notebook’s right side, a sturdy, dark steel pen rested quietly, its tip shimmering with a soft light. Its cap lay beside a revolver, its barrel gleaming with a faint brass sheen.\n\nA revolver? A six-shooter? Zhou Mingrui froze, utterly taken aback. The scene before him was utterly alien, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to his own room!\n\nDisorientation and bewilderment washed over him as he noticed that the desk, the notebook, the ink bottle, even the revolver, seemed veiled in a thin, crimson \"gauze\"—a faint glow filtering in from outside.\n\nInstinctively, he raised his head, letting his gaze slowly ascend:\nIn the air above, a dark \"velvet curtain\" stretched out, upon which hung a blood-red, full moon, serene and radiating.\n\nThis... Zhou Mingrui felt an inexplicable dread. He sprang to his feet, but before his legs fully straightened, another sharp pain struck his head, stealing his strength, causing his center of gravity to falter. His backside slammed hard against the hard wood of the chair.\n\n*Thump!*\n\nThe impact did little more than jolt him. Gripping the desk, Zhou Mingrui pushed himself upright, turning frantically to take in his surroundings.\n\nThe room was small, with doors on either side, and a wooden bunk bed pressed against the wall opposite. Between the left door and the bunk lay a cabinet with an upper shelf and five drawers below. At chest height on the left wall, another set of grey-white pipes ran, terminating in a peculiar mechanical contraption, its gears and bearings partially exposed.\n\nNear the desk, a wooden corner held a coal stove and various kitchen utensils—pots, pans. Beyond the right door lay a cracked穿衣镜 (mirror), its wooden base simple and unadorned.\n\nGlancing around, Zhou Mingrui caught sight of himself in the mirror—a figure of medium build, black hair, brown eyes, wearing a flaxen shirt, thin and with average features but deeper contours...\n\nThis... Zhou Mingrui let out a sharp inhale, his heart filled with a sense of utter helplessness and disarray. The revolver, the Western classical furnishings, and that crimson moon unlike any on Earth—all pointed to something profound.\n\nAm I... have I crossed over? Zhou Mingrui’s mouth gaped slightly.\n\nHe’d grown up reading online fiction, often fantasizing about such scenarios, but the reality was a shock, leaving him momentarily unable to process.\n\nSeconds later, a pang of bitterness twisted his lips—he mused self-deprecatingly, like the story of Yu Gong who admired dragons but was afraid of them.\n\nHad the persistent pain kept his mind sharp, he might have doubted that this was merely a dream.\n\nCalm down, calm down... Taking deep breaths, Zhou Mingrui fought to quell the rising panic.\n\nJust then, as his mind and body settled, fragments of memory surged into his consciousness, presenting themselves slowly, one by one!\n\nCai Lian. Mo Li Di. Born in Ting’en City, Awwa County, Loen Kingdom, a recent graduate of Khoy University’s history department...\n\nHis father, a Royal Army sergeant, had died in a colonial conflict on the southern continent, his pension allowing Cai Lian entry into a private grammar school, laying the foundation for university...\n\nHis mother, a devotee of the Evernight Goddess, passed away the year he passed the Khoy University entrance exam...\n\nHe had an older brother and a younger sister, living together in a two-bedroom apartment...\n\nThe family was not wealthy, bordering on poverty, solely sustained by his brother’s job as a clerk in an import-export company...\n\nAs a history graduate, Cai Lian possessed Ancient Feysac, the purported ancestor of all northern continent scripts, and Hermes, the ancient language often found in tombs, linked to祭祀 and prayer...\n\nHermes? Zhou Mingrui’s heart skipped a beat. He pressed his aching temple, his gaze fixed on the notebook. The strange letters on the yellowed paper began to shift, from alien to familiar, from familiar to decipherable.\n\nThis is written in Hermes!\n\nThe deep, almost dripping ink declared:\n\n*“All mortals must die, including me.”*\n\nSsssh! Zhou Mingrui felt an inexplicable terror, instinctively recoiling, trying to distance himself from the notebook and those words.\n\nHe felt weak, nearly collapsing. He grabbed the desk edge, his trembling limbs steadying. The air around him seemed agitated, whispers faint yet pervasive in his ears, like childhood tales spun by elders to frighten children.\n\nShaking his head, he realized it was all a hallucination. He steadied himself, his breathing heavy, and tore his gaze from the notebook.\n\nHis eyes then fell upon the revolver, its brass gleam catching the light. A question suddenly struck him.\n\n*“With Cai Lian’s financial situation, how could he afford a revolver?”* Zhou Mingrui frowned.\n\nLost in thought, he noticed a half-fingerprint of blood on the desk’s edge, its colour darker than the moonlight, thicker than the gauze.\n\nA bloodstain!\n\n*“Bloodstain?”* Zhou Mingrui instinctively flipped open his right hand, peering down. His palm and fingers were smeared with blood.\n\nSimultaneously, the headache returned, slightly lessened but persistent.\n\n*“Did I hit my head?”* Zhou Mingrui wondered, turning his body towards the cracked mirror.\n\nAfter a few steps, his reflection—a man of medium height, black hair, brown eyes, bearing the unmistakable air of study—came into clear view.\n\nThis... is me now, Cai Lian. Mo Li Di?\n\nZhou Mingrui froze. The lighting was poor from the crimson moonlight, making it hard to discern. He stepped closer, almost colliding with the mirror.\n\nUsing the faint, gauzy moonlight, he tilted his head to inspect his temple.\n\nThe mirror, clear as a bell, showed a狰狞 (狰狞 means fierce or monstrous) wound nestled against his temple, its edges scorched, surrounded by blood.",

Zhou Mingrui felt an inexplicable dread. He sprang to his feet, but before his legs could fully extend, another sharp pain seized him, stealing his strength, causing his center of gravity to falter. His backside slammed hard against the hard wood of the chair.\n\n*Thump!*\n\nThe impact did little more than jolt him. Gripping the desk, Zhou Mingrui pushed himself upright, turning frantically to take in his surroundings.\n\nThe room was small, with doors on either side, and a wooden bunk bed pressed against the wall opposite. Between the left door and the bunk lay a cabinet with an upper shelf and five drawers below. At chest height on the left wall, another set of grey-white pipes ran, terminating in a peculiar mechanical contraption, its gears and bearings partially exposed.\n\nNear the desk, a wooden corner held a coal stove and various kitchen utensils—pots, pans. Beyond the right door lay a cracked穿衣镜 (mirror), its wooden base simple and unadorned.\n\nGlancing around, Zhou Mingrui caught sight of himself in the mirror—a figure of medium build, black hair, brown eyes, wearing a flaxen shirt, thin and with average features but deeper contours...\n\nThis... Zhou Mingrui let out a sharp inhale, his heart filled with a sense of utter helplessness and disarray. The revolver, the Western classical furnishings, and that crimson moon unlike any on Earth—all pointed to something profound.\n\nAm I... have I crossed over? Zhou Mingrui’s mouth gaped slightly.\n\nHe’d grown up reading online fiction, often fantasizing about such scenarios, but the reality was a shock, leaving him momentarily unable to process.\n\nSeconds later, a pang of bitterness twisted his lips—he mused self-deprecatingly, like the story of Yu Gong who admired dragons but was afraid of them.\n\nHad the persistent pain kept his mind sharp, he might have doubted that this was merely a dream.\n\nCalm down, calm down... Taking deep breaths, Zhou Mingrui fought to quell the rising panic.\n\nJust then, as his mind and body settled, fragments of memory surged into his consciousness, presenting themselves slowly, one by one!\n\nZhou Mingrui. Born in Tingen City, Awwa County, Loen Kingdom, a recent graduate of Khoy University’s history department...\n\nHis father, a Royal Army sergeant, had died in a colonial conflict on the southern continent, his pension allowing Zhou Mingrui entry into a private grammar school, laying the foundation for university...\n\nHis mother, a devout follower of The Evernight Goddess, passed away the year he passed the Khoy University entrance exam...\n\nHe had an older brother and a younger sister, living together in a two-bedroom apartment...\n\nThe family was not wealthy, bordering on poverty, solely sustained by his brother’s job as a clerk in an import-export company...\n\nAs a history graduate, Zhou Mingrui possessed Ancient Feysac, the purported ancestor of all northern continent scripts, and Hermes, the ancient language often found in tombs, linked to sacrifice and prayer...\n\nHermes? Zhou Mingrui’s heart skipped a beat. He pressed his aching temple, his gaze fixed on the notebook. The strange letters on the yellowed paper began to shift, from alien to familiar, from familiar to decipherable.\n\nThis is written in Hermes!\n\nThe deep, almost dripping ink declared:\n\n*“All mortals must die, including me.”*\n\nSsssh! Zhou Mingrui felt an inexplicable terror, instinctively recoiling, trying to distance himself from the notebook and those words.\n\nHe felt weak, nearly collapsing. He grabbed the desk edge, his trembling limbs steadying. The air around him seemed agitated, whispers faint yet pervasive in his ears, like childhood tales spun by elders to frighten children.\n\nShaking his head, he realized it was all a hallucination. He steadied himself, his breathing heavy, and tore his gaze from the notebook.\n\nHis eyes then fell upon the revolver, its brass gleam catching the light. A question suddenly struck him.\n\n*“With Zhou Mingrui’s financial situation, how could he afford a revolver?”* Zhou Mingrui frowned.\n\nLost in thought, he noticed a half-fingerprint of blood on the desk’s edge, its colour darker than the moonlight, thicker than the gauze.\n\nA bloodstain!\n\n*“Bloodstain?”* Zhou Mingrui instinctively flipped open his right hand, peering down. His palm and fingers were smeared with blood.\n\nSimultaneously, the headache returned, slightly lessened but persistent.\n\n*“Did I hit my head?”* Zhou Mingrui wondered, turning his body towards the cracked mirror.\n\nAfter a few steps, his reflection—a man of medium height, black hair, brown eyes, bearing the unmistakable air of study—came into clear view.\n\nThis... is me now, Zhou Mingrui?\n\nZhou Mingrui froze. The lighting was poor from the crimson moonlight, making it hard to discern. He stepped closer, almost colliding with the mirror.\n\nUsing the faint, gauzy moonlight, he tilted his head to inspect his temple.\n\nThe mirror, clear as a bell, showed a狰狞 (monstrous) wound nestled against his temple, its edges scorched, surrounded by blood.",
