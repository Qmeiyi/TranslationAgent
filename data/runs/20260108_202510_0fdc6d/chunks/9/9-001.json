  "source": "休息了半个小时，已经自认为克莱恩的周明瑞才缓了过来，其间他发现自己右手手背多了四个黑点，恰好组成小的正方形。\n这四个黑点由深变淡，很快消失，但克莱恩清楚，它们依旧藏在自己体内，等待着唤醒。\n“四点，正方形，难道是四个角落四份主食的对应？以后我就不需要再准备主食，可以直接上步伐和咒文了？”克莱恩隐隐有了一个猜测。\n这看起来似乎不错，但身上多了点来历奇诡，缺乏了解的“东西”总是让人恐惧。\n再想到地球上莫名其妙的方术在这里竟然也能产生效果，再想到自身睡梦中的奇怪穿越，再想到神秘、迷幻、不知代表着什么的灰雾世界，再想到“仪式”之中徘徊于周围，让人接近发疯的阵阵耳语，克莱恩就难以克制地打了个寒颤，在六月底的炎热天气里打了个寒颤。\n他曾经听说过一句话：“人类最古老又最强烈的情感是恐惧，而最古老又最强烈的恐惧是对未知的恐惧”，现在，他就深刻体会到了来源于未知的恐惧。\n前所未有的，无法遏制的，他升起了想要接触神秘领域，了解更多，破除未知的强烈冲动，也有着把头一埋，假装什么事情都没有发生的逃避念头。\n窗外阳光正盛，为书桌铺上了一层“金粉”，克莱恩凝望着那里，仿佛触摸到了一丝温暖和希望。\n他稍微放松了一点，立刻感觉汹涌的疲惫潮水般涌出。\n昨晚的未眠，刚才的消耗，让他眼皮沉重像是铅白，止不住地下垂。\n摇了摇脑袋，克莱恩伸手撑住桌缘，顾不得收拾放置于四角的黑麦面包，踉踉跄跄走到高低床前，刚一躺下，沾到枕头，就昏睡了过去。\n咕噜！咕噜！\n饥饿唤醒了克莱恩，他睁开眼睛，一阵神清气爽。\n“除了头还有点疼。”他揉了揉额角，翻身坐起，觉得自己现在能吃掉整整一头牛。\n他边理顺衣服的褶皱，边回到书桌旁，拿起了那块有枝蔓纹的银白怀表。\n啪！\n盖子弹开，秒针滴答滴答地走着。\n“十二点半，睡了三个多小时……”克莱恩吞咽唾沫，将怀表放进了亚麻衬衣口袋。\n在北大陆，一天同样分成二十四小时，每小时六十分钟，每分钟六十秒，至于每一秒钟的长度和地球是不是一样，克莱恩就不得而知了。\n对他来说，此时此刻连神秘学、仪式、灰雾世界等单词都无法进入脑海，当前最重要的事情是食物，食物！\n吃饱了才能想办法！才能做事情！\n没有犹豫，克莱恩将四个角落的黑麦面包又拿了回来，弹甩掉沾染的少许灰尘，打算拿其中一条作为中午的主食。\n因为家乡有分食祭祀后供品的习俗，而这四条黑麦面包看起来又没有任何改变，他在兜里只剩五个便士的情况下，觉得做人还是得勤俭节约一点。\n当然，这也有原主记忆碎片、生活习惯的微妙影响。\n因为煤气太贵，用在照明上都让人心疼，他搬出炉子，添了些煤炭，克莱恩来回踱步，等待着水开。\n那种黑麦面包，干吃会噎着的！\n“哎，难道要过早上黑面包，中午黑面包，晚上才能吃肉的生活……不，要不是梅丽莎为我即将到来的面试考虑，一周才能吃两回肉的……”无所事事又因饥饿没法思考严肃问题的克莱恩左顾右盼。\n想到那磅羔羊肉，他望着橱柜的眼神都似乎有点发绿了。\n“不行，不行，得等着梅丽莎一块吃。”克莱恩猛地摇头，否定了先切一半现在做的想法。\n作为一个漂泊在大城市的单身狗，他虽然以吃外食为主，但基本的厨艺还是磨练出来了，谈不上好吃，但也够用了。\n转过身体，克莱恩打算眼不见为净，就在这时，他忽地记起早上除了买肉，还买了嫩豌豆，买了土豆！\n土豆！克莱恩瞬间有了灵感，旋风般扭回去，冲到橱柜旁，从不多的土豆里拿出两个。\n他先去公用盥洗室将土豆的表皮清洗得干干净净，接着直接将它们放入壶里，与水共煮。\n过了好一阵子，他从橱柜里拿出调料盒，揭开盖子，往水里洒了一点点泛黄又粗糙的盐。\n又耐心等待了几分钟，克莱恩提起水壶，将不算汤的汤倒入几个杯子，倒入大碗，最后才将两个土豆叉了出来，放于桌上。\n呼！\n他剥一点皮就往手上吹口气，煮熟土豆的香味一点点弥漫出来，勾人食欲。\n口水疯狂分泌，克莱恩顾不得只剥了一半，顾不得土豆还有点发烫，拿起就狠狠咬了一口。\n粉！香！回口泛甜！克莱恩的内心瞬间充满感动，狼吞虎咽般解决掉了两个土豆，甚至吃了些皮进去。\n直到这个时候，他才拿起大碗，美美地喝了口“汤”，淡淡的盐味冲刷掉了满嘴的发干。\n“小时候最爱这么吃了……”垫了垫肚子的克莱恩一边无声感慨，一边掰断黑麦面包，用“汤”泡软了吃。\n或许是之前的“仪式”消耗太大，他足足吃了两条，整整一磅。\n喝“汤”，收拾，克莱恩感觉自己彻底活了过来，又体验到了生而为人的愉快，又享受到了阳光的灿烂。\n他坐回书桌前，开始思考自己接下来该做什么。\n“不能逃避，必须得想办法接触神秘领域，成为‘正义’和‘倒吊人’口中的非凡者。”\n“要战胜因未知导致的害怕。”\n“目前唯一的途径是等待下一次的‘聚会’，看能不能旁听到‘观众’魔药的配方，或者别的神秘知识。”\n“到周一还有四天，在此之前，得正视原主本身的问题了，他为什么自杀，他遭遇了什么事情……”\n没法穿越回去，拍拍屁股就走的克莱恩拿起那本摊开的笔记，打算翻翻有没有什么线索，看能不能补全残缺的记忆碎片。\n很显然，原主有记笔记的习惯，也有拿笔记当日记的爱好。\n克莱恩清楚地知道，充当书桌右腿的柜子里，满满都是写完的笔记本。\n这一本是从5月10号开始使用的，最前面多是涉及学校，涉及导师，涉及知识的内容：\n“5月12日，阿兹克先生提到南大陆拜朗帝国的通用语也源自古弗萨克语，也就是巨人语的一个分支。为什么会这样？难道所有具备灵性的生物都曾经使用同一种语言，不，这一定是错误的，哪怕在《夜之启示录》和《风暴之书》的记载里，在比古老更古老的时代中，巨人也不是唯一的大陆主宰，还有精灵，还有异种，还有巨龙，好吧，这都只是传说，只是神话故事。”\n……\n“5月16日，科恩资深副教授和阿兹克先生讨论蒸汽时代的必然性，阿兹克先生认为这具备偶然性，要不是突然出现罗塞尔大帝，也许北大陆还和南大陆一样，依旧处于冷兵器时代，导师认为他太过强调个体的作用，他相信随着时代的发展，没有罗塞尔大帝，还有罗伯特大帝，总之，蒸汽时代或许会迟到，但肯定会到来。对他们的争辩，我只感觉没有什么意义，我更喜欢发现新的东西，将被迷雾笼罩的历史还原，也许，我不该读历史系，该读考古系。”\n……\n“5月29日，韦尔奇找到我，说是获得了一本第四纪元的笔记。我的女神，第四纪的笔记！他不想去求考古系的同学，想请我和娜娅帮忙解读记载的内容，这种事情，我怎么可能拒绝？当然，得安排在毕业答辩之后，这个时候，我不能分心。”\n看到这里，克莱恩精神一振，比起前面的读史笔记、观念争论，新出现的“第四纪”笔记更有可能导致原主的自杀。\n第四纪是如今“黑铁纪元”前的那个时代，有关它的历史充满迷雾，诸多缺失，就连出土的陵寝、古城和文献都少之又少，历史学家和考古学家们只能借助于七大教会含糊不清、以信仰教育为主的神学典籍才能勉强拼凑出一点“原貌”，知道所罗门帝国、图铎王朝、特伦索斯特帝国的存在。\n立志于破开迷雾，还原历史的克莱恩对更偏神话传说的“前三纪”没什么兴趣，只在乎又称“众神时代”的第四纪，激动可想而知。\n“嘿，这么一瞧，原主看重面试，担忧将来的就业，其实没有必要啊……”克莱恩忍不住感叹了一句。\n当前大学还很稀少，绝大多数学生是贵族子弟和有钱人家孩子，平民只要进入，哪怕因身份受到歧视，不被纳入别人的社交圈，但只要本身不极端，靠着分组讨论、集体活动等事情，还是能获得一定人脉资源的，相当珍贵的人脉资源！\n比如韦尔奇.麦格文就是鲁恩王国间海郡康斯顿城一名银行家的儿子，为人豪爽，出手阔绰，因为长期和克莱恩、娜娅分在一个小组做作业做报告，所以习惯性请他们帮忙。\n没多发散思维，克莱恩继续往下阅读笔记：\n“6月18日，毕业了。别了，我的霍伊大学！”\n“6月19日，我看到了那本笔记，经过结构、词根等的对比，发现它是古弗萨克语的一个变种，更准确地说，一千多年的历史里，古弗萨克语其实一直都在微小地衍变着。”\n“6月20日，我们解读出了第一页的内容，作者是一个叫做‘安提哥努斯’的家族的成员。”\n“6月21日，他提到了‘黑皇帝’，这和前面内容推导出的时代完全矛盾，难道导师的看法是错误的，‘黑皇帝’其实是所罗门帝国每一位皇帝的共同称号？”\n“6月22日，这个叫做‘安提哥努斯’的家族在所罗门帝国似乎有着显赫地位，笔记主人提到自己在和某个叫做图铎的人进行一项秘密交易。图铎？图铎王朝？”\n“6月23日，我控制自己不去想那本笔记，不去韦尔奇那里，我要准备面试了！这是非常重要的事情！”\n“6月24日，娜娅告诉我，他们有了新的收获，我想我该去看一看。”\n“6月25日，从新解读出的内容看，笔记的主人接受了一个任务，前往‘霍纳奇斯’山脉的主峰，去拜访位于顶端的‘夜之国’，我的女神，霍纳奇斯山脉的主峰超过六千米，怎么可能有国家存在？他们靠什么存活！”\n“6月26日，这些奇怪的东西都是真的吗？”\n到这里，笔记就结束了，周明瑞是6月28日凌晨穿越过来的。\n“也就是说，6月27日的笔记其实有，是那一句……‘所有人都会死，包括我’……”克莱恩翻到最初看见的那页，略感毛骨悚然地做出判断。\n他觉得要解开原主自杀之谜，应该去一趟韦尔奇那里，再看一看古老笔记的内容，但有着丰富的小说、电影、电视剧“经验”的他感觉如果自己去了，如果事情确实有关，那多半会遭遇未知的危险——那些明知古堡有鬼还去作死的家伙们就是警示录！\n可不去又不行，逃避永远解决不了问题，只会让事情越累越大，直到决堤涌来，彻底淹没掉自身！\n报警？总不能说我自杀了吧……\n咚！\n咚咚！\n门口忽然传来一阵急促有力的敲门声。\n克莱恩猛地坐直，侧耳倾听。\n咚！\n咚咚！\n敲门声回荡于空旷寂寥的楼层过道内。",
  "draft": "\n**Chapter Title:** Chapter 9: Notes\n\nAfter resting for half an hour, Zhou Mingrui, having fully assumed the identity of Cai Lian Mo Rui, felt himself regain his composure. During this time, he discovered four black spots on the back of his right hand, arranged in a small square formation.\n\nThese four spots faded from darkness to light and vanished quickly, but Cai Lian knew they remained dormant within his body, waiting for the right moment to awaken.\n\n\"Four points, a square—does this correspond to the four cardinal directions and their respective main provisions? Perhaps I no longer need to prepare these staples and can directly proceed to the steps and incantations?\" Cai Lian vaguely speculated.\n\nIt seemed like a promising idea, yet the presence of something inexplicable and foreign within him only intensified the fear. The thought that inexplicable occult practices from Earth could yield results here, coupled with his strange, inexplicable transition into this world, and the enigmatic, hallucinatory Grey Mist realm, all contributed to a chilling shiver that wracked him, even in the sweltering heat of late June.\n\nHe had once heard a saying: \"Man's oldest and most profound emotion is fear, and the deepest of all fears is the fear of the unknown.\" Now, Cai Lian deeply felt the terror born from the unknown.\n\nUnprecedented and uncontrollable, a strong impulse surged within him—a desire to delve into the mysteries, to learn more, to unravel the unknown. Yet, there was also a tendency to bury his head in the sand, pretending as if nothing had happened.\n\nThe sunlight streaming through the window cast a golden glow upon his desk, as if offering a touch of warmth and hope. He gazed at it, feeling a moment of respite. However, the exhaustion washed over him in an overwhelming tide.\n\nThe lack of sleep from the previous night and the recent expenditure of energy weighed heavily upon his eyelids, making them feel leaden and forcing them downward. He shook his head, reached out to support himself on the edge of the desk, and, ignoring the four corners where the rye bread lay, stumbled towards the bunk bed. As soon as he lay down and touched the pillow, he drifted into a deep sleep.\n\nGurgle! Gurgle!\n\nHunger awoke him. He opened his eyes, feeling refreshed.\n\n\"Besides the lingering headache,\" he rubbed his temples and sat up, suddenly feeling an appetite so strong he could devour an entire ox.\n\nAs he smoothed out the wrinkles in his clothes and returned to the desk, he picked up the silver watch with its vine-like pattern.\n\nClick!\n\nThe cover snapped open, and the second hand ticked steadily.\n\n\"Half past twelve. I slept for more than three hours...\" Cai Lian swallowed, placing the watch into the pocket of his linen shirt.\n\nIn the North Continent, time was divided into twenty-four hours, each hour sixty minutes, and each minute sixty seconds. Whether each second felt the same as on Earth, he could not know.\n\nAt that moment, even words like mysticism, rituals, or the Grey Mist world refused to enter his mind. The most pressing matter was sustenance—food! Without food, how could he devise a plan? How could he accomplish anything?\n\nWithout hesitation, Cai Lian retrieved the four loaves of rye bread, shook off the faint dust, and planned to use one as his midday meal. Due to his limited five pennies, and influenced by fragments of the original host's memories and habits, he felt it necessary to practice frugality.\n\nAfter all, gas was too expensive, even for lighting. He moved the stove, added some coal, and paced back and forth, waiting for the water to boil.\n\nDry-eating rye bread was sure to cause discomfort!\n\n\"Ah, does this mean a life of rye bread for breakfast, lunch, and then meat for dinner? No, it’s not that bad. If it weren't for Melissa’s consideration for my upcoming interview, I could only afford meat once a week...\"\n\nCai Lian looked around helplessly, his hunger preventing him from contemplating serious matters.\n\nThe thought of the one-pound lamb meat made his eyes take on a greenish hue as he stared at the cabinets.\n\n\"No, no, I must wait for Melissa to join me,\" he shook his head firmly, dismissing the idea of eating alone.\n\nAs a lone wanderer in the bustling city, though reliant on eating out, Cai Lian had honed his basic cooking skills. It wasn't gourmet, but it was sufficient.\n\nTurning his body, Cai Lian decided to leave it at that, but just then, he remembered he had also purchased tender peas and potatoes earlier that morning.\n\nPotatoes! Inspiration struck him instantly. He spun around, rushed to the cabinets, and took out two of the few potatoes he had.\n\nHe went to the public restroom, washed the potatoes clean, and placed them directly into the pot with the water.\n\nAfter a while, he retrieved the spice box from the cabinet, opened the lid, and sprinkled a little yellow, coarse salt into the water.\n\nPatiently waiting a few more minutes, Cai Lian poured the thin soup-like liquid into several cups and a large bowl, then took out the potatoes with a fork and placed them on the table.\n\nHuff!\n\nAs he peeled a bit of the skin and blew on his hand, the aroma of the cooked potatoes slowly弥漫ed, enticing his appetite.\n\nSaliva flowed uncontrollably. Ignoring the fact that he had only peeled half and the potatoes were still hot, he took a large bite.\n\nPowdered, fragrant, with a hint of sweetness on the palate! Cai Lian's heart swelled with emotion. He devoured the two potatoes with gusto, even eating the skin.\n\nOnly then did he pick up the large bowl and take a satisfying sip of the \"soup,\" the faint saltiness cleansing the dryness in his mouth.\n\n\"Back when I was a child, I loved this the most...\" Cai Lian silently reflected, breaking the rye bread and dipping it into the \"soup\" to soften it before eating.\n\nPerhaps the previous \"ritual\" had drained him significantly, as he consumed two loaves, an entire pound. After drinking the \"soup\" and tidying up, Cai Lian felt truly revitalized, experiencing the joy of being human and basking in the warmth of the sunlight.\n\nHe returned to his desk and began to ponder his next steps.\n\n\"I cannot evade this. I must find a way to engage with the mysterious domain, to become a 'Beyonder' recognized by 'Justice' and 'The Hanged Man'.\"\n\n\"I must overcome the fear born from the unknown.\"\n\n\"The only path available at the moment is to wait for the next 'gathering,' hoping to overhear the 'Audience Potion' recipe or other esoteric knowledge.\"\n\n\"There are still four days until Monday. Before then, I must confront the issues inherent in the original host. Why did he commit suicide? What happened to him?\"\n\nUnable to return to his original world and simply walk away, Cai Lian picked up the open notebook and decided to flip through it, hoping to find clues that might piece together the fragmented memories.\n\nClearly, the original host had a habit of taking notes and treating them as a diary.\n\nCai Lian knew that the cabinet beneath his desk was filled with countless completed notebooks.\n\nThis particular one started from May 10th, its contents initially focused on school, professors, and academic topics:\n\n\"May 12th: Mr. Azir mentioned that the common language of the southern continent's Bayren Empire also originates from Ancient Feysac, a branch of the Giant language. Why is that? Could all sentient beings have once spoken the same language? No, this must be wrong. Even according to the 'Night Revelation' and 'The Book of Storms,' in an era older than antiquity, giants were not the sole rulers of the continents; there were also elves, aberrations, and dragons. Well, these are just legends, mythological stories.\"\n\n...\n\n\"May 16th: I discussed the inevitability of the Steam Age with Senior Professor Cohen and Mr. Azir. Mr. Azir believed it was a matter of chance; without the sudden appearance of Emperor Rosier, perhaps the North Continent would still be in the same state as the South, remaining in the age of cold兵器. My professor, however, felt he overstated the role of individuals. He believed that with the progression of time, without Rosier or Emperor Robert, the Steam Age might be delayed but would eventually arrive. Their debate seemed to me to lack significance. I prefer to discover new things and uncover the obscured history. Perhaps, I shouldn't have studied history; maybe archaeology would be more suitable.\"\n\n...\n\n\"May 29th: Welch found me and said he had obtained a notebook from the Fourth Era. My goddess, a notebook from the Fourth Era! He didn't want to bother his archaeology friends and asked me and Naya for help in deciphering its contents. How could I refuse? Of course, it had to be after the graduation defense, as I couldn't afford to be distracted at this time.\"\n\nHere, Cai Lian's spirits lifted. Compared to the historical notes and debates on ideologies, this newly discovered \"Fourth Era\" notebook was more likely to explain the original host's suicide.\n\nThe Fourth Era was the epoch preceding the current Black Iron Era, shrouded in mist and missing many details. Even the tombs, ancient cities, and documents from that period were scarce. Historians and archaeologists could only piece together a faint outline through the ambiguous theological texts of the Seven Churches, which were primarily faith-based education. They knew of the Solomon Empire, the Tudor Dynasty, and the T'lan C'thur Empire.\n\nCai Lian, determined to unravel the mist and restore history, had little interest in the \"Third Era\" or earlier, which leaned more towards mythology. His excitement was palpable.\n\n\"Well, upon closer inspection, the original host's concern for the interview and future employment was unnecessary...\"\n\nUniversities were still relatively scarce, and the vast majority of students were nobility or wealthy children. While commoners faced discrimination and exclusion from social circles, they could still build valuable人脉 through group discussions and collective activities.\n\nFor example, Welch McGowan, son of a banker in Kingdonshire, Intershire, was known for his generosity. Due to their habit of working together on assignments and reports with Cai Lian and Naya, he often treated them.\n\nWith his mind wandering, Cai Lian continued reading the notes:\n\n\"June 18th: Graduation. Farewell, my Khoy University!\"\n\n\"June 19th: I examined that notebook. Through structural and root comparisons, I determined it was a variant of Ancient Feysac. More precisely, Ancient Feysac had been subtly evolving for over a thousand years.\"\n\n\"June 20th: We deciphered the first page's content. The author belonged to a family named 'Antigonus'.\"\n\n\"June 21st: He mentioned the 'Black Emperor.' This contradicted the era deduced from the previous content. Could my professor be wrong? Was the 'Black Emperor' a title held by every emperor of the Solomon Empire?\"\n\n\"June 22nd: The family named 'Antigonus' held significant status within the Solomon Empire. The notebook's owner mentioned engaging in a secret transaction with someone named Tudor. Tudor? Tudor Dynasty?\"\n\n\"June 23rd: I forced myself not to think about that notebook, not to go to Welch's place. I must prepare for the interview! It's a very important matter!\"\n\n\"June 24th: Naya told me they had new findings. I think I should go and see what they discovered.\"\n\n\"June 25th: Based on the newly deciphered content, the notebook's owner accepted a mission to travel to the summit of the 'Horachies' Mountains to visit the 'Land of Night' at its peak. My goddess, the summit of the Horachies Mountains exceeds six thousand meters—how could a country exist there? How do they survive?\"\n\n\"June 26th: Are all these strange things real?\"\n\nThe notebook ended there, and Zhou Mingrui had arrived on this world on the early morning of June 28th.\n\n\"So, the notes from June 27th must exist. It was probably that sentence... 'Everyone will die, including me...'\"\n\nCai Lian turned to the first page he had seen, making a judgment that sent a chill down his spine.\n\nTo unravel the mystery of the original host's suicide, he should visit Welch and examine the ancient notebook. However, drawing from his experience in novels, films, and TV shows, he suspected that if he went, and if the matter was indeed connected, he would likely face unknown dangers—those who recklessly ventured into haunted castles served as a stark warning!\n\nYet, he could not avoid it. Avoidance would never solve the problem; it would only allow the issue to grow, accumulate, and eventually overwhelm him completely.\n\nShould he call the authorities?

  "back_translation": "\n**第九章：杂记**\n\n休息了半个小时，周明瑞完全代入了蔡莲慕瑞这个角色，感觉自己的心绪渐渐平复下来。这段时间，他发现自己的右手手背上多了四道黑斑，呈一个小方块状排列。\n\n这四道黑斑从深色逐渐变浅，转瞬即逝，但蔡莲知道它们并未消失，而是潜伏在体内，等待着合适的时机苏醒。\n\n“四点，一个方块——难道这对应着四象和各自的主食？或许我不再需要准备这些主食，可以直接进行步骤和咒语了？”蔡莲模糊地推测着。\n\n这似乎是个不错的主意，然而，体内存在的某种不可名状的异物感反而加剧了恐惧。地球上的神秘学在这里能奏效，这种不可名状的 occult 实践，加上自己莫名其妙地穿越到这个世界，以及那个充满幻觉的灰雾领域，这一切都让他感到一阵寒意，即使在六月末的酷暑中也难以抑制。\n\n他曾听人说过：“人类最古老、最原始、最深刻的情感是恐惧，而最深的恐惧，莫过于对未知的恐惧。”此刻，蔡莲深深体会到了这种未知带来的恐惧。\n\n前所未有、无法控制，一股强烈的冲动在他心中涌动——想要探索神秘，想要了解更多，想要揭开未知的面纱。然而，也有种逃避现实的倾向，想要装作若无其事。\n\n阳光透过窗户洒在他的书桌上，仿佛带来了一丝温暖和希望。他凝视着这一切，感到片刻的宁静。然而，疲惫感如潮水般汹涌而来。\n\n前一晚的睡眠不足，加上最近的消耗，让他的眼皮沉重得几乎要垂下，他摇了摇头，伸手撑在书桌边缘，无视了桌角的黑麦面包，踉跄地走向上下铺。一躺下，接触到枕头，他就陷入了深深的睡眠。\n\n咕噜咕噜！\n\n饥饿感将他唤醒。他睁开眼睛，感觉精神了不少。\n\n“除了隐隐作痛的头痛，”他揉了揉太阳穴坐起身，突然感到食欲大开，仿佛能吞下一整头牛。\n\n整理好衣服上的褶皱，回到书桌前，他拿起那个带有藤蔓图案的银质怀表。\n\n咔哒！\n\n表盖打开，秒针稳定地走动着。\n\n“十二点半了。我睡了三个多小时……”蔡莲咽了口口水，将怀表塞进亚麻衬衫的口袋里。\n\n在北大陆，时间被划分为二十四小时，每小时六十分钟，每分钟六十秒。至于每一秒是否和地球一样，他不得而知。\n\n那一刻，连“神秘学”、“仪式”或者“灰雾世界”这些词都不愿出现在他的脑海里。最紧迫的事情是温饱——食物！没有食物，他如何制定计划？如何完成任何事情？\n\n毫不犹豫，蔡莲拿出了四块黑麦面包，抖掉上面的灰尘，打算用一块作为午餐。由于他只有五枚硬币，加上原主记忆和习惯的碎片化影响，他觉得有必要节俭一点。\n\n毕竟，煤气太贵了，就连照明都费钱。他移动了炉子，加了一些煤，来回踱步，等待水烧开。\n\n干着吃黑麦面包肯定会不舒服！\n\n“啊，难道以后早餐、午餐都是黑麦面包，晚餐才能吃肉吗？不，也没那么糟。要不是梅丽莎考虑我即将面试的事情，我一周也只能吃一次肉……”\n\n蔡莲无奈地环顾四周，饥饿让他无法思考严肃的事情。\n\n一磅的羊肉排让他眼睛绿光一闪，盯着橱柜。\n\n“不，不，我得等梅丽莎一起。”他坚定地摇了摇头，打消了独自吃肉的念头。\n\n作为一个在繁华都市中的孤独流浪者，虽然依赖外出就餐，但蔡莲也掌握了一些基本的烹饪技巧。虽然不是什么大厨，但足够应付了。\n\n转过身，蔡莲决定到此为止，但就在这时，他想起早上还买了嫩豌豆和土豆。\n\n土豆！灵感瞬间袭来。他转过身，冲到橱柜前，拿出了几颗土豆中的两颗。\n\n他去了公共卫生间，把土豆洗干净，直接放进锅里加水。\n\n过了一会儿，他从橱柜里拿出香料盒，打开盖子，往水里撒了一点黄色的粗盐。\n\n耐心地等待了几分钟，蔡莲将稀薄的汤状液体倒入几个杯子和一个大碗里，然后用叉子把土豆夹出来，放在桌子上。\n\n呼！\n\n他剥了一点皮，吹了吹手，煮好的土豆的香气慢慢弥漫开来，勾起了他的食欲。\n\n唾液不受控制地分泌。他无视了只剥了一半、土豆还热的事实，大口咬了下去。\n\n粉糯、香甜、在口中留下一丝甜味！蔡莲心中涌起一股情感。他狼吞虎咽地吃掉两个土豆，连皮都吃了。\n\n这才拿起大碗，满意地喝了一口“汤”，淡淡的咸味清除了口中的干涩。\n\n“小时候最喜欢这个了……”蔡莲默默地想着，掰开黑麦面包，蘸着“汤”软化后才吃下去。\n\n或许是之前的“仪式”消耗太大，他吃掉了两块面包，还有一整磅的土豆。喝完“汤”、收拾好后，蔡莲感觉真正恢复了精神，体验到了作为人类的快乐，沐浴在阳光的温暖中。\n\n他回到书桌前，开始思考下一步该怎么做。\n\n“我不能逃避。我必须想办法接触神秘领域，成为一个‘越境者’，被‘正义’和‘倒吊人’认可。”\n\n“我必须克服未知带来的恐惧。”\n\n“目前唯一可行的途径是等待下一次‘聚会’，希望能听到‘观众药剂’的配方或其他神秘知识。”\n\n“还有四天就是周一了。在此之前，我必须面对原主遗留的问题。他为什么会自杀？发生了什么？”\n\n无法回到原来的世界，也不能简单地走开，蔡莲拿起摊开的笔记本，决定翻阅一下，希望能找到一些线索，拼凑起破碎的记忆。\n\n显然，原主有记笔记的习惯，并且把它们当作日记。\n\n蔡莲知道，书桌下方的柜子里塞满了无数本写完的笔记本。\n\n这本从五月十号开始写起，内容最初集中在学校、教授和学术话题上：\n\n“五月十二日：阿兹尔先生提到，南方大陆拜伦帝国的通用语也源自古费亚萨克，这是巨人语的一个分支。为什么会这样？难道所有智慧生物都曾说同一种语言吗？不，这一定不对。即使根据《夜之启示》和《风暴之书》，在比古神时代更早的时期，巨人也不是大陆的唯一统治者，还有精灵、畸变体和龙。嗯，这些只是传说，神话故事罢了。”\n\n……\n\n“五月十六日：我和阿兹尔先生讨论了蒸汽时代的必然性。阿兹尔先生认为这是偶然；如果没有罗西尔皇帝的突然出现，也许北大陆至今仍像南大陆一样，停留在冷兵器时代。我的教授则认为他夸大了个人的作用。他认为，随着时代的推进，即使没有罗西尔或罗伯特皇帝，蒸汽时代也会延迟但最终到来。在我看来，他们的争论似乎毫无意义。我更喜欢发现新事物，揭开被掩盖的历史。也许，我当初不该学历史；也许考古学更适合我。”\n\n……\n\n“五月二十九日：韦尔奇找到我，说他从第四纪获得了一本笔记本。我的女神，是第四纪的笔记本！他不想麻烦他的考古学朋友，让我和娜雅帮忙解读内容。我怎么可能拒绝？当然，必须在毕业答辩之后，我现在可没空分心。”\n\n蔡莲的精神为之一振。比起历史笔记和意识形态的争论，这本新发现的“第四纪”笔记本更有可能解释原主的自杀原因。\n\n第四纪是当前黑铁纪之前的纪元，充满了迷雾，细节缺失。就连那个时代的陵墓、古城和文献都很少见。历史学家和考古学家只能通过七座教堂模糊的神学文献勉强拼凑出一个轮廓，而这些文献主要是信仰教育。他们知道所罗门帝国、都铎王朝和“天裂之兽”帝国。\n\n蔡莲决心揭开迷雾，还原历史，对“第三纪”或更早的时期，那些偏向神话的内容，兴趣不大。他的兴奋之情溢于言表。\n\n“嗯，仔细想想，原主对面试和未来工作的担忧是不必要的……”\n\n大学仍然比较稀缺，绝大多数学生都是贵族或富家子弟。平民虽然会受到社会圈子的排斥和歧视，但仍然可以通过小组讨论和集体活动建立宝贵的人脉。\n\n比如，肯丁郡间郡的银行家之子韦尔奇·麦高恩，以慷慨大方著称。由于蔡莲和娜雅习惯与他一起完成作业和报告，他经常请他们吃饭。\n\n思绪飘飞，蔡莲继续阅读笔记：\n\n“六月十八日：毕业。再见，我的科约大学！”\n\n“六月十九日：我检查了那本笔记本。通过结构和词根比较，我确定它是古费亚萨克的一个变体。更准确地说，古费亚萨克在一千多年里悄然演变。”\n\n“六月二十日：我们解读了第一页的内容。作者姓‘安提贡努斯’。”\n\n“六月二十一日：他提到了‘黑皇帝’。这与之前内容推断的时代不符。难道我的教授错了？‘黑皇帝’是所罗门帝国每位皇帝的称号吗？”\n\n“六月二十二日：姓‘安提贡努斯’的家族在所罗门帝国中地位显赫。笔记本的主人提到与一个叫都铎的人进行秘密交易。都铎？都铎王朝？”\n\n“六月二十三日：我强迫自己不去想那本笔记本，不去韦尔奇那里。我必须准备面试！这非常重要！”\n\n“六月二十四日：娜雅告诉我他们有了新发现。我觉得我应该去看看他们发现了什么。”\n\n“六月二十五日：根据新解读的内容，笔记本的主人接受了一项任务，前往‘霍拉奇斯’山脉的顶峰，拜访那里的‘黑夜之地’。我的女神，霍拉奇斯山脉的顶峰超过六千米——一个国家怎么可能存在于那里？他们是怎么生存的？”\n\n“六月二十六日：所有这些奇怪的事情都是真的吗？”\n\n笔记本在这里结束了，周明瑞在六月二十八日凌晨抵达了这个世界。\n\n“那么，六月二十七日的笔记应该存在。大概是那句话……‘所有人都会死，包括我……’”\n\n蔡莲翻到他见过的第一页，做出了一个让他脊背发凉的判断。\n\n要解开原主自杀之谜，他应该去韦尔奇那里，看看那本古老的笔记本。然而，根据小说、电影和电视剧的经验，他怀疑如果去了，而且事情真的有关联，他很可能会遭遇未知的危险——那些贸然闯入鬼城堡的人，就是最好的警示！\n\n然而，他不能逃避。逃避永远无法解决问题，只会让问题不断积累，最终将他完全淹没。\n\n该报警吗？他可不能说自己要自杀。\n\n咚！咚咚！\n\n一声响亮而有力的敲门声在门外回荡。\n\n蔡莲坐直了身体，努力倾听。\n\n咚！\n\n咚咚！\n\n敲门声在空旷、荒凉的走廊里回响。",

  "final_translation": "\n**Chapter Title:** Chapter 9: Notes\n\nAfter resting for half an hour, Zhou Mingrui, having fully assumed the identity of Cai Lian Mo Rui, felt himself regain his composure. During this time, he discovered four black spots on the back of his right hand, arranged in a small square formation.\n\nThese four spots faded from darkness to light and vanished quickly, but Cai Lian knew they remained dormant within his body, waiting for the right moment to awaken.\n\n\"Four points, a square—does this correspond to the four cardinal directions and their respective main provisions? Perhaps I no longer need to prepare these staples and can directly proceed to the steps and incantations?\" Cai Lian vaguely speculated.\n\nIt seemed like a promising idea, yet the presence of something inexplicable and foreign within him only intensified the fear. The thought that inexplicable occult practices from Earth could yield results here, coupled with his strange, inexplicable transition into this world, and the enigmatic, hallucinatory Grey Mist realm, all contributed to a chilling shiver that wracked him, even in the sweltering heat of late June.\n\nHe had once heard a saying: \"Man's oldest and most profound emotion is fear, and the deepest of all fears is the fear of the unknown.\" Now, Cai Lian deeply felt the terror born from the unknown.\n\nUnprecedented and uncontrollable, a strong impulse surged within him—a desire to delve into the mysteries, to learn more, to unravel the unknown. Yet, there was also a tendency to bury his head in the sand, pretending as if nothing had happened.\n\nThe sunlight streaming through the window cast a golden glow upon his desk, as if offering a touch of warmth and hope. He gazed at it, feeling a moment of respite. However, the exhaustion washed over him in an overwhelming tide.\n\nThe lack of sleep from the previous night and the recent expenditure of energy weighed heavily upon his eyelids, making them feel leaden and forcing them downward. He shook his head, reached out to support himself on the edge of the desk, and, ignoring the four corners where the rye bread lay, stumbled towards the bunk bed. As soon as he lay down and touched the pillow, he drifted into a deep sleep.\n\nGurgle! Gurgle!\n\nHunger awoke him. He opened his eyes, feeling refreshed.\n\n\"Besides the lingering headache,\" he rubbed his temples and sat up, suddenly feeling an appetite so strong he could devour an entire ox.\n\nAs he smoothed out the wrinkles in his clothes and returned to the desk, he picked up the silver watch with its vine-like pattern.\n\nClick!\n\nThe cover snapped open, and the second hand ticked steadily.\n\n\"Half past twelve. I slept for more than three hours...\" Cai Lian swallowed, placing the watch into the pocket of his linen shirt.\n\nIn the Loen Kingdom, time was divided into twenty-four hours, each hour sixty minutes, and each minute sixty seconds. Whether each second felt the same as on Earth, he could not know.\n\nAt that moment, even words like mysticism, rituals, or the Grey Mist world refused to enter his mind. The most pressing matter was sustenance—food! Without food, how could he devise a plan? How could he accomplish anything?\n\nWithout hesitation, Cai Lian retrieved the four loaves of rye bread, shook off the faint dust, and planned to use one as his midday meal. Due to his limited five pennies, and influenced by fragments of the original host's memories and habits, he felt it necessary to practice frugality.\n\nAfter all, gas was too expensive, even for lighting. He moved the stove, added some coal, and paced back and forth, waiting for the water to boil.\n\nDry-eating rye bread was sure to cause discomfort!\n\n\"Ah, does this mean a life of rye bread for breakfast, lunch, and then meat for dinner? No, it’s not that bad. If it weren't for Melissa’s consideration for my upcoming interview, I could only afford meat once a week...\"\n\nCai Lian looked around helplessly, his hunger preventing him from contemplating serious matters.\n\nThe thought of the one-pound lamb meat made his eyes take on a greenish hue as he stared at the cabinets.\n\n\"No, no, I must wait for Melissa to join me,\" he shook his head firmly, dismissing the idea of eating alone.\n\nAs a lone wanderer in the bustling city, though reliant on eating out, Cai Lian had honed his basic cooking skills. It wasn't gourmet, but it was sufficient.\n\nTurning his body, Cai Lian decided to leave it at that, but just then, he remembered he had also purchased tender peas and potatoes earlier that morning.\n\nPotatoes! Inspiration struck him instantly. He spun around, rushed to the cabinets, and took out two of the few potatoes he had.\n\nHe went to the public restroom, washed the potatoes clean, and placed them directly into the pot with the water.\n\nAfter a while, he retrieved the spice box from the cabinet, opened the lid, and sprinkled a little yellow, coarse salt into the water.\n\nPatiently waiting a few more minutes, Cai Lian poured the thin soup-like liquid into several cups and a large bowl, then took out the potatoes with a fork and placed them on the table.\n\nHuff!\n\nAs he peeled a bit of the skin and blew on his hand, the aroma of the cooked potatoes slowly弥漫ed, enticing his appetite.\n\nSaliva flowed uncontrollably. Ignoring the fact that he had only peeled half and the potatoes were still hot, he took a large bite.\n\nPowdered, fragrant, with a hint of sweetness on the palate! Cai Lian's heart swelled with emotion. He devoured the two potatoes with gusto, even eating the skin.\n\nOnly then did he pick up the large bowl and take a satisfying sip of the \"soup,\" the faint saltiness cleansing the dryness in his mouth.\n\n\"Back when I was a child, I loved this the most...\" Cai Lian silently reflected, breaking the rye bread and dipping it into the \"soup\" to soften it before eating.\n\nPerhaps the previous \"ritual\" had drained him significantly, as he consumed two loaves, an entire pound. After drinking the \"soup\" and tidying up, Cai Lian felt truly revitalized, experiencing the joy of being human and basking in the warmth of the sunlight.\n\nHe returned to his desk and began to ponder his next steps.\n\n\"I cannot evade this. I must find a way to engage with the mysterious domain, to become a 'Beyonder' recognized by 'Justice' and 'The Hanged Man'.\"\n\n\"I must overcome the fear born from the unknown.\"\n\n\"The only path available at the moment is to wait for the next 'gathering,' hoping to overhear the 'Audience Potion' recipe or other esoteric knowledge.\"\n\n\"There are still four days until Monday. Before then, I must confront the issues inherent in the original host. Why did he commit suicide? What happened to him?\"\n\nUnable to return to his original world and simply walk away, Cai Lian picked up the open notebook and decided to flip through it, hoping to find clues that might piece together the fragmented memories.\n\nClearly, the original host had a habit of taking notes and treating them as a diary.\n\nCai Lian knew that the cabinet beneath his desk was filled with countless completed notebooks.\n\nThis particular one started from May 10th, its contents initially focused on school, professors, and academic topics:\n\n\"May 12th: Mr. Azir mentioned that the common language of the southern continent's Bayren Empire also originates from Ancient Feysac, a branch of the Giant language. Why is that? Could all sentient beings have once spoken the same language? No, this must be wrong. Even according to the 'Night Revelation' and 'The Book of Storms,' in an era older than antiquity, giants were not the sole rulers of the continents; there were also elves, aberrations, and dragons. Well, these are just legends, mythological stories.\"\n\n...\n\n\"May 16th: I discussed the inevitability of the Steam Age with Senior Professor Cohen and Mr. Azir. Mr. Azir believed it was a matter of chance; without the sudden appearance of Emperor Rosier, perhaps the North Continent would still be in the same state as the South, remaining in the age of cold兵器. My professor, however, felt he overstated the role of individuals. He believed that with the progression of time, without Rosier or Emperor Robert, the Steam Age might be delayed but would eventually arrive. Their debate seemed to me to lack significance. I prefer to discover new things and uncover the obscured history. Perhaps, I shouldn't have studied history; maybe archaeology would be more suitable.\"\n\n...\n\n\"May 29th: Welch found me and said he had obtained a notebook from the Fourth Era. My goddess, a notebook from the Fourth Era! He didn't want to bother his archaeology friends and asked me and Naya for help in deciphering its contents. How could I refuse? Of course, it had to be after the graduation defense, as I couldn't afford to be distracted at this time.\"\n\nHere, Cai Lian's spirits lifted. Compared to the historical notes and debates on ideologies, this newly discovered \"Fourth Era\" notebook was more likely to explain the original host's suicide.\n\nThe Fourth Era was the epoch preceding the current Black Iron Era, shrouded in mist and missing many details. Even the tombs, ancient cities, and documents from that period were scarce. Historians and archaeologists could only piece together a faint outline through the ambiguous theological texts of the Seven Churches, which were primarily faith-based education. They knew of the Solomon Empire, the Tudor Dynasty, and the T'lan C'thur Empire.\n\nCai Lian, determined to unravel the mist and restore history, had little interest in the \"Third Era\" or earlier, which leaned more towards mythology. His excitement was palpable.\n\n\"Well, upon closer inspection, the original host's concern for the interview and future employment was unnecessary...\"\n\nUniversities were still relatively scarce, and the vast majority of students were nobility or wealthy children. While commoners faced discrimination and exclusion from social circles, they could still build valuable人脉 through group discussions and collective activities.\n\nFor example, Welch McGowan, son of a banker in Kingdonshire, Intershire, was known for his generosity. Due to their habit of working together on assignments and reports with Cai Lian and Naya, he often treated them.\n\nWith his mind wandering, Cai Lian continued reading the notes:\n\n\"June 18th: Graduation. Farewell, my Khoy University!\"\n\n\"June 19th: I examined that notebook. Through structural and root comparisons, I determined it was a variant of Ancient Feysac. More precisely, Ancient Feysac had been subtly evolving for over a thousand years.\"\n\n\"June 20th: We deciphered the first page's content. The author belonged to a family named 'Antigonus'.\"\n\n\"June 21st: He mentioned the 'Black Emperor.' This contradicted the era deduced from the previous content. Could my professor be wrong? Was the 'Black Emperor' a title held by every emperor of the Solomon Empire?\"\n\n\"June 22nd: The family named 'Antigonus' held significant status within the Solomon Empire. The notebook's owner mentioned engaging in a secret transaction with someone named Tudor. Tudor? Tudor Dynasty?\"\n\n\"June 23rd: I forced myself not to think about that notebook, not to go to Welch's place. I must prepare for the interview! It's a very important matter!\"\n\n\"June 24th: Naya told me they had new findings. I think I should go and see what they discovered.\"\n\n\"June 25th: Based on the newly deciphered content, the notebook's owner accepted a mission to travel to the summit of the 'Horachies' Mountains to visit the 'Land of Night' at its peak. My goddess, the summit of the Horachies Mountains exceeds six thousand meters—how could a country exist there? How do they survive?\"\n\n\"June 26th: Are all these strange things real?\"\n\nThe notebook ended there, and Zhou Mingrui had arrived on this world on the early morning of June 28th.\n\n\"So, the notes from June 27th must exist. It was probably that sentence... 'Everyone will die, including me...'\"\n\nCai Lian turned to the first page he had seen, making a judgment that sent a chill down his spine.\n\nTo unravel the mystery of the original host's suicide, he should visit Welch and examine the ancient notebook. However, drawing from his experience in novels, films, and TV shows, he suspected that if he went, and if the matter was indeed connected, he would likely face unknown dangers—those who recklessly ventured into haunted castles served as a stark warning!\n\nYet, he could not avoid it. Avoidance would never solve the problem; it would only allow the issue to grow, accumulate, and eventually overwhelm him completely.\n\nShould he call the authorities? He couldn't very well tell them he had committed suicide.\n\nKnock! Knock knock!\n\nA sharp, forceful knock echoed at the door.\n\nCai Lian sat upright, straining to listen.\n\nKnock!\n\nKnock knock!\n\nThe knocking reverberated through the empty, desolate hallway.",
