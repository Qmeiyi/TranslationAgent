  "draft": "\n**Chapter Title:** The Dawn of a New Era\n\n**English Draft:**\n\n**Part 1: The Tempest at Sea**\n\nAaaah!\nThe wind howled, the rain fell in torrents, the three-masted ship surged between wave after wave, cresting and plunging, tossed like a toy by the giants of the sea.\n\nAlgernon Wilson’s eyes, once shadowed with a deep, unnerving red, seemed to fade, leaving him still standing on the deck, unchanged from before.\n\nThen, he witnessed the peculiar glass bottle in his hand, grotesque in shape, shatter with a crisp *crack*. Frost, snow-like, melted into water, mingling with the raindrops.\n\nIn mere seconds, the ancient artifact was utterly gone, leaving no trace of its former existence.\n\nA shard of crystalline snow, hexagonal in form, appeared in Algernon’s palm. It rapidly dissipated, vanishing as if receding into the flesh itself.\n\nAlgernon nodded almost imperceptibly, as if pondering something profound. He remained utterly still for five long minutes.\n\nTurning his body, he walked towards the ship’s cabin entrance. Just as he was about to enter, he met a man stepping out, clad in a robe adorned with electric blue lightning patterns.\n\nThe man with the soft, honey-blonde hair paused, his gaze fixed on Algernon. He extended his right hand, fist clenched over his chest.\n\n\"Storm with you.\"\n\nAlgernon’s face, rugged and profound, devoid of any extraneous emotion, mirrored the gesture, clenching his own right fist over his left breast.\n\nAfter exchanging formal greetings, Algernon entered the cabin, moving down the passageway towards the captain’s quarters beyond.\n\nThroughout his journey, he encountered no sailors or crewmen. The ship was unnervingly silent, as still and empty as the interior of a tomb.\n\nThe captain’s door opened, revealing a plush, deep-brown carpet. Bookshelves and a liquor cabinet lined the sides. Yellowed bookbindings and dark, crimson wine bottles gleamed with an otherworldly light under the flickering candlelight.\n\nOn the candlelit desk sat an inkwell, a quill pen, a black metal telescope, and a brass sextant.\n\nBehind the desk, a middle-aged man, pale-faced, wearing a skull captain’s hat, watched Algernon approach. His lips curled in fury as he ground his teeth.\n\n\"I will not yield!\"\n\n\"You can do it,\" Algernon replied, his voice calm as if commenting on the day’s weather.\n\n\"You...\" The man froze, utterly unprepared for such a response.\n\nIn that instant, Algernon’s body tensed, and he lunged forward, closing the distance between them to mere inches.\n\n*Crack!*\n\nHis shoulder tightened, and his right hand shot out, clamping onto the man’s throat before he could react.\n\nPhantomscales shimmered on his hand, and his fingers flexed with terrifying strength.\n\n*Clink!*\n\nWith a sharp sound, the man’s eyes widened in shock as he was lifted entirely off his feet.\n\nHis legs thrashed violently, but his expression quickly settled into a blank stare. His pupils dilated, and the area beneath his trousers began to dampen, accompanied by a foul stench.\n\nAlgernon hoisted the man, bent his back, and took a stride towards the wall beside him.\n\n*Thump!* He used the man as a shield, slamming him forcefully against the forward wall.\n\nThe wooden panels splintered and shattered. The狂暴的风雨, carrying the briny tang of the sea, surged into the cabin.\n\nAlgernon twisted his torso, and with a throw, he sent the man crashing out of the cabin and into the churning sea, cresting wave upon cresting wave.\n\nDarkness, howling wind, and the raw power of nature swallowed everything.\n\nAlgernon pulled out a white handkerchief, wiped his right palm clean, and then tossed it into the sea.\n\nStepping back, he waited patiently for his companion to enter.\n\n\"What happened?\" Within seconds, the man with the honey-blonde hair burst in.\n\n\"The Captain... escaped,\" Algernon panted, his tone tinged with frustration. \"He still retains some...非凡之力!\"\n\n\"Damn it!\" The blonde man cursed under his breath.\n\nHe moved to the breach in the wall, staring intently into the distance. But all he saw was wind, rain, and the churning sea.\n\n\"Let it be,\" the blonde man waved a dismissive hand. \"He was merely an incidental. Finding this Tudor ghost ship is our gain.\"\n\nEven for a favored servant of the sea, he dared not risk venturing into the water in this weather.\n\n\"And if the storm continues,\" Algernon nodded, noting the visible, almost animate repair of the wooden wall. \"The Captain won’t last much longer.\"\n\nHe cast a sidelong glance, his head twisting instinctively towards the helm and the sails.\n\nThrough layers of wood, he could perceive their state.\n\nNo first mate. No second mate. No sailors. No ordinary seamen. Not a single living soul.\n\nThe helm and sails adjusted themselves, silently and unnervingly.\n\nA vision of the man obscured by grey and white mist, \"The Fool,\" flashed in his mind. Algernon sighed, a sound of weary resignation.\n\nHe turned to the raging storm outside, his voice a fragmented whisper, laced with both anticipation and dread.\n\n\"A new era has begun...\"\n\n**Part 2: The Heart of the City**\n\nIn the Queen's Quarter, the capital of Loen Kingdom, Backlund, Audrye Holl nipped her cheek, unable to fathom what had just transpired.\n\nBefore her, the antique copper mirror on her dressing table lay in shattered fragments.\n\nLowering her gaze, Audrye saw the \"Deep Red\" flowing across her hand, like a tattoo of stars.\n\nThe \"Deep Red\" gradually faded, vanishing beneath her skin.\n\nOnly then did Audrye confirm that she was not dreaming.\n\nHer eyes flickered with a liquid light, her lips curved slowly upwards. She stood, bending to gather her skirts.\n\nWith a curtsey to the empty air, Audrye moved with light steps, her body turning fluidly. She danced the \"Ancient Elven Dance,\" the latest宫廷流行舞, a radiant smile blooming on her face.\n\n*Tap-tap-tap!* The door to her room was knocked upon.\n\n\"Who is it?\" Audrye stopped abruptly, assuming a demure posture.\n\n\"Miss, may I enter? It is time for you to prepare,\" her lady’s maid asked from outside the door.\n\nAudrye glanced sideways at the broken mirror, quickly suppressing her smile, leaving only a faint line.\n\nShe examined herself left and right, satisfied with her appearance, then spoke softly.\n\n\"Enter.\"\n\nTwisting her wrist, her lady’s maid, Annie, pushed the door open.\n\n\"Oh, it’s shattered…\" Annie immediately noticed the state of the antique mirror.\n\nAudrye blinked, her voice slow and deliberate.\n\n\"Well, yes, um, Susie was here, you know. It just… likes to break things!\" Susie was a large, golden retriever with less than pure lineage, a gift from her father, Baron Holl, while hunting foxes, but dearly loved by Audrye.\n\n\"You need to discipline her properly,\" Annie said, expertly cleaning up the mirror shards, careful not to cut her mistress.\n\nFinished, she looked at Audrye, a small smile playing on her lips.\n\n\"What dress would you like?\"\n\n\"Ah, the one designed by Mistress Ginny for my seventeenth birthday,\" Audrye replied, thinking.\n\n\"No, that’s impossible. If someone were to see you wearing it again in a formal occasion, they would question the Holl family’s financial stability!\" Annie shook her head.\n\n\"But I truly adore it,\" Audrye insisted, her tone gentle.\n\n\"You can wear it at home, in less formal settings,\" Annie stated firmly.\n\n\"Then the one Sir Sedus brought yesterday, the one with the lace at the sleeves,\" Audrye said, holding her breath, maintaining her elegant, sweet smile.\n\n\"You always have such excellent taste,\" Annie smiled, stepping back towards the door. \"Number Six wardrobe, never mind, I’ll get it myself.\"\n\nThe maids sprang into action. One took charge of the gown, another of the jewels, another of the shoes, another of the纱帽 (silk hat), one for dressing Audrye, and one for considering the hairstyle.\n\nAs preparations wound down, the Baron, wearing a dark brown waistcoat and matching hat, with neatly trimmed sideburns, appeared at the doorway. His sapphire eyes held a cheerful glint, though the松弛的肌肉 (loose muscles), protruding belly, and deepening法令纹 (法令 lines) marred the handsome man he once was.\n\n\"The jewel of Backlund, it is time to depart,\" Baron Holl announced, standing at the entrance, lightly tapping the open door.\n\n\"Father, please do not call me that,\" Audrye said, rising with her maid’s assistance, feigning a touch of vexation.\n\n\"Then, my lovely princess, it is time to go,\" the Baron bent his left arm, gesturing for her to take his arm.\n\nAudrye offered a faint smile and shook her head.\n\n\"This is Lady Holl, your mother. Her place.\"\n\n\"Then this way,\" the Baron smiled, bending his right arm. \"This is the pride of a father.\"\n\n**Part 3: The Ironclad and the Age of Steam**\n\nWhen Audrye, arm-in-arm with her father, descended from the carriage at Priz Port, Oak Island, Royal Naval Base, she was struck dumb by the behemoth before her.\n\nIn the nearby harbor lay a vessel of staggering proportions, its entire body shimmering with metallic glory. Gone were the sails, replaced by two towering smokestacks and two open-air gun turrets, one forward, one aft. It stood majestic, immense, dwarfing the nearby sailing battleships, which looked like mere children beside its colossus.\n\n\"By the storm...\"\n\n\"Oh, my God.\"\n\n\"Ironclad!\"\n\nThe murmurs rose, a low, collective gasp. Audrye felt the same awe, the wonder of human ingenuity, a miracle of the sea unlike any before.\n\nIt took an indeterminate time for the nobles, ministers, and members of the House of Commons to regain their composure. Just then, a black dot appeared in the sky, growing larger, blotting out a third of the heavens, commanding all attention and casting a sudden pall over the scene.\n\nA colossal creature drifted and flew through the air. Its lines were incredibly fluid and elegant, painted in deep blue. A sturdy, light alloy frame supported the fabric housing airbags below, with casings for cannons, grenade launchers, and flat-trajectory guns visible on its underbelly. The cacophony of high-spirit steam engines and the frantic whirring of the propellers formed a symphony of awe-inspiring power.\n\nThe royal family’s airship had arrived, its descent marked by an air of supreme authority.\n\nOn either side of the carriage厢体 (compartment), the \"Judgment Sword\" emblem, a vertical sword set with a ruby crown, reflected the sunlight. A symbol of the Augusta family, its legacy stretching back to the previous era.\n\nAudrye, not yet eighteen, had not undergone the \"Introduction Ceremony,\" the formal entry into Backlund’s social scene presided over by the Queen, signifying her adulthood. She could only observe from the sidelines, unable to approach.\n\nStill, she paid it little mind, even feeling a sense of relief at not having to mingle with the princes.\n\nThe \"miracle\" of human flight settled onto the ground. First out climbed youthful guardsmen, clad in red uniforms and white trousers, bearing rifles, standing at rigid attention, forming two ranks as King George III and his family, along with the princes and princesses, emerged.\n\nAudrye hadn’t seen royalty often, but she showed no interest. Her gaze drifted to the two black-armored knights standing beside the monarch, like stone statues.\n\nIn this age of steel, steam, and artillery, there were still men clad head-to-toe in armor!\n\nThe cold gleam of the metal, the deep black of the helmets, radiated a sense of weight, solemnity, and unquestioning obedience.\n\n\"Could they be the higher-tier 'Disciplinarian Knights'...\" Audrye thought of idle conversations among her family’s elders. Curious, yet daunted, she dared not come closer.\n\nWith the king’s family arrived, the ceremony began. Lord Agughe Ngen, the current Secretary of State for War and the Navy, stepped forward.\n\nA conservative figure, one of only two non-noble prime ministers to date, he had been elevated to Lord for his exceptional contributions.\n\nBut Audrye knew more. His elder brother, the mainstay of the Conservatives, was Lord Palas Ngen, the Duke of this generation!\n\nAgughe, in his late fifties, thin and somewhat balding, with sharp, piercing eyes, surveyed the crowd.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he began, his voice resonating with authority. \"You have seen it. This is an ironclad, a vessel capable of overturning the tides of history. Length: 101 meters. Beam: 21 meters. Height: Designed around the main deck. Main armor belt: 457mm thick. Displacement: 10,060 tons. Four 305mm main guns, forward and aft. Additionally, six rapid-fire guns, eighteen 6-pounders, and forty-six six-barreled machine guns. Four torpedo tubes. Speed: Up to 16 knots!\"\n\n\"It shall be the undisputed master of the waves! It shall conquer the sea!\"\n\nNobleman, ministers, and parliamentarians stirred uneasily. Even Agughe’s description painted a terrifying picture, but the sight of the vessel itself confirmed the horror.\n\nA faint smile touched Agughe’s lips. He delivered a few more words before bowing to King George III.\n\n\"Majesty, it is time to name it.\"\n\n\"It shall be called 'Priz',\" the King announced, his expression clearly pleased.\n\n\"Priz!\"\n\n\"Priz!\"\n\nThe name spread, passed from the Secretary of State, the Chief of the Naval Staff, onwards, until it reached the officers and men aboard the ironclad, who cheered in unison.\n\n\"Hail Priz!\"\n\nAs celebrations erupted, salvos of artillery echoed through the air. King George III gave the order for departure and trials.\n\nAaaah!\nThe whistle blew, thick smoke billowed from the funnels, the sounds of machinery faintly audible.\n\nThe leviathan moved. As it cleared the port and opened fire on an uninhabited island ahead with its bow-mounted guns, everyone present gasped.\n\n*BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!*\n\nThe earth seemed to tremble. Dust choked the air. A hurricane-force wind whipped across the water, tossing the waves into a frenzy.\n\nAgughe Ngen turned, a satisfied smile on his face. He addressed the nobles, ministers, and parliamentarians.\n\n\"From this moment forth, those seven self-styled 'Generals' of piracy, those four who dared to usurp the title of King, can only tremble, awaiting their end!\"\n\n\"Their era is over. No matter what '非凡之力' (extraordinary power) they may possess, no matter the ghost ships or curses, the sea shall be dominated by the ironclad!\"\n\nJust then, Agughe’s chief secretary interjected deliberately.\n\n\"But can they build such an ironclad themselves?\"\n\nSome nobles and members of parliament nodded silently, considering the possibility.\n\nAgughe’s smile vanished, replaced by a slow shake of his head.\n\n\"No. Impossible. Utterly impossible! To construct such a vessel requires three large coal-steel integrated plants, twenty steelworks of a certain scale, the expertise of sixty scientists and countless senior engineers from the Backlund Ordnance Research Institute and the Priz Shipbuilding Research Institute.

"\n**章节标题：新时代的曙光**\n\n**第一部分：海上风暴**\n\n啊啊啊！\n狂风怒吼，暴雨倾盆，三桅帆船在惊涛骇浪中起伏颠簸，如同被海中巨人玩弄于股掌之间。\n\n阿尔杰农·威尔逊眼中那抹令人不安的深红色阴影似乎消散了，他依然站在甲板上，与之前毫无二致。\n\n接着，他目睹手中那支奇特的玻璃瓶碎裂开来，清脆的“咔嚓”声中，冰霜般的雪花融化成水，与雨水混合在一起。\n\n短短几秒钟内，这件古老神器便彻底消失，仿佛从未存在过。\n\n一片水晶般的雪花，六边形的形状，在阿尔杰农掌心浮现。它迅速消散，仿佛融入了皮肉之中。\n\n阿尔杰农几乎难以察觉地点了点头，似乎在思索着什么深奥的问题。他一动不动地站立了整整五分钟。\n\n转身走向船舱入口，就在即将进入的瞬间，他遇到了一个从里面走出来的人，那人身披绣有电蓝色闪电纹样的长袍。\n\n金发蜜色的男子停下脚步，目光锁定在阿尔杰农身上。他伸出右手，拳头紧握在胸前。\n\n“风暴与你同在。”\n\n阿尔杰农面色深沉，毫无多余的表情，镜像般模仿着对方的动作，将左拳紧握在胸前。\n\n寒暄过后，阿尔杰农走进船舱，沿着通道走向更深处的船长室。\n\n整个航程中，他没有遇到任何水手或船员。这艘船异常寂静，如同坟墓般空旷死寂。\n\n船长室的门打开，映入眼帘的是一块华美深棕色的地毯。书架和酒柜沿着两侧摆放。泛黄的书脊和深红的酒瓶在摇曳的烛光下闪烁着异界般的光芒。\n\n烛光摇曳的书桌上，摆着墨水瓶、羽毛笔、黑色金属望远镜和黄铜六分仪。\n\n在书桌后面，一位面色苍白的中年男子，头戴骷髅船长帽，注视着阿尔杰农走近。他咬紧牙关，嘴唇因愤怒而扭曲。\n\n“我绝不会屈服！”\n\n“你可以做到，”阿尔杰农平静地回答，声音如同在谈论天气，“就像现在这样。”\n\n“你……”男子浑身一僵，完全没料到会是这样的回应。\n\n就在那一瞬间，阿尔杰农的身体紧绷，猛地向前一扑，两人之间的距离瞬间缩短到不足一寸。\n\n“咔嚓！”\n\n他的肩膀肌肉紧绷，右手闪电般探出，钳住了对方的喉咙，对方甚至来不及反应。\n\n幻影鳞片在他掌心闪烁，手指间迸发出骇人的力量。\n\n“咔！”\n男子瞪大双眼，惊恐万分，整个人被抛离了地面。\n\n双腿徒劳地抽搐着，但他的表情迅速变得呆滞。瞳孔放大，裤子下摆开始洇湿，一股恶臭弥漫开来。\n\n阿尔杰农将他高高举起，反剪双手，迈出一步，撞向旁边的墙壁。\n\n“砰！”他用这人当盾牌，狠狠地将他砸向船舱前方的墙壁。\n\n木板碎裂崩飞，狂暴的风雨携着咸腥的海味席卷了整个船舱。\n\n阿尔杰农扭转上身，随手将那人抛了出去，撞破舱门，坠入汹涌的海浪之中，被浪头反复吞噬。\n\n黑暗、呼啸的风声，以及原始自然的力量吞噬了一切。\n\n阿尔杰农掏出一方白手帕，擦拭干净右手，然后随手扔进海里。\n\n退后一步，他耐心地等待着同伴的到来。\n\n“怎么回事？”金发男子转瞬即至。\n\n“船长……逃了，”阿尔杰农喘息着说，语气中带着挫败，“他还保留着一些……非凡之力！”\n\n“该死！”金发男子低声咒骂。\n\n他走向破开的墙壁，凝视着远方。但除了风、雨和汹涌的海面，什么也看不见。\n\n“随他去吧，”金发男子随意挥了挥手，“他不过是些偶然因素。找到这艘都铎鬼船才是我们的收获。”\n\n即便是受宠的海之仆人，在这样的天气里也不敢冒险出海。\n\n“如果风暴持续，”阿尔杰农点点头，注意到那几乎有了生命迹象的木质墙壁正在自行修复，“船长撑不了多久了。”\n\n他侧目一瞥，头颅本能地转向舵盘和帆的位置。\n\n透过层层木板，他能感知到它们的状态。\n\n没有大副。没有二副。没有水手。没有普通海员。一个活人也没有。\n\n舵盘和帆正在自行调整，无声地令人不安。\n\n灰白迷雾中闪现的模糊身影，“愚者”，在他脑海中闪过。阿尔杰农叹了口气，带着疲惫的认命。\n\n他转向外面的狂风暴雨，声音支离破碎，却交织着期待与恐惧。\n\n“一个新时代开始了……”\n\n**第二部分：城市的脉搏**\n\n在洛恩王国首都贝尔恩区的女王区，奥德丽·霍尔坐在梳妆台前，脸颊被“深红”划过，却无法理解刚才发生了什么。\n\n面前，她那把古铜色的铜镜已经碎裂成无数碎片。\n\n低下头，奥德丽看到“深红”在她手上流淌，如同星纹烙印。\n\n“深红”逐渐消退，隐没在她的皮肤之下。\n\n直到那时，奥德丽才确认自己并非梦中。\n\n眼眸中泛着流动的光泽，唇角缓缓上扬。她站起身，弯腰整理裙摆。\n\n对着空无一人的空气行了个屈膝礼，奥德丽轻盈地移动着身体，流畅地转身。她跳起了“古老精灵之舞”，脸上绽放着灿烂的笑容。\n\n“叩叩叩！”房门被敲响了。\n\n“谁啊？”奥德丽突然停下，摆出一副端庄的姿态。\n\n“小姐，该您准备了，可以进来了吗？”她的女伴在门外问道。\n\n奥德丽瞥了一眼破碎的镜子，迅速压下笑意，只留下一道浅浅的痕迹。\n\n她左顾右盼，满意自己的外表，轻声说道。\n\n“进来吧。”\n\n扭动手腕，女伴安妮推门而入。\n\n“哦，碎了……”安妮立刻注意到那把古董镜子的状况。\n\n奥德丽眨了眨眼，声音缓慢而有条理。\n\n“嗯，是的，苏茜在，你知道的。它……就是喜欢打碎东西！”苏茜是一只大型金毛寻回犬，血统不够纯正，是她父亲霍尔男爵打猎狐狸时送的礼物，但深受奥德丽喜爱。\n\n“你需要好好管教她，”安妮熟练地清理着碎片，小心不要伤到女主人。\n\n收拾完毕，她看着奥德丽，嘴角带着一丝笑意。\n\n“您想穿哪件衣服？”\n\n“啊，吉妮夫人设计的那件，为我十七岁生日准备的，”奥德丽思考着回答。\n\n“不行，那不可能。如果有人看到您在正式场合再次穿它，会质疑霍尔家族的财力！”安妮摇头。\n\n“但我真的很喜欢，”奥德丽坚持道，语气轻柔。\n\n“可以在家里穿，非正式场合，”安妮坚定地说。\n\n“那塞杜斯先生昨天带来的那件呢，袖口有蕾丝的那件，”奥德丽屏住呼吸，保持着优雅甜美的微笑。\n\n“你总是有这么好的品味，”安妮笑了笑，退后一步，“第六号衣柜，不用了，我自己会拿。”\n\n女伴们立刻行动起来。一人负责衣服，一人负责珠宝，一人负责鞋子，一人负责纱帽，一人负责给奥德丽更衣，一人负责考虑发型。\n\n准备工作接近尾声时，男爵穿着深棕色马甲和相配的帽子，整洁的山羊胡修剪得一丝不苟，出现在门口。他那蓝宝石般的眼睛闪烁着愉快的光芒，尽管松弛的肌肉、突出的肚子和加深的法令纹，掩盖了他曾经英俊的面容。\n\n“贝尔恩的明珠，是时候启程了，”霍尔男爵宣布，站在门口，轻轻敲了敲敞开的门。\n\n“父亲，别叫我这个，”奥德丽在女伴搀扶下站起身，假装有些不悦。\n\n“那么，我可爱的小公主，是时候出发了，”男爵抬起左臂，示意她挽住自己的手。\n\n奥德丽露出一丝浅笑，摇了摇头。\n\n“这位是你的母亲，霍尔夫人。她的位置。”\n\n“那这边走吧，”男爵笑了笑，抬起右臂，“这是父亲的骄傲。”\n\n**第三部分：铁甲舰与蒸汽时代**\n\n当奥德丽挽着父亲的手臂，在橡岛皇家海军基地普里兹港下车时，眼前的庞然大物让她失声凝噎。\n\n不远处的港口停泊着一艘难以想象的巨舰，整艘船闪耀着金属的光泽。帆已不见踪影，取而代之的是两座高耸的烟囱和两个露天炮塔，一个在前，一个在后。它巍峨壮观，庞大无比，相比之下，附近的风帆战列舰显得渺小如孩童。\n\n“天啊……”\n\n“哦，我的天。”\n\n“铁甲舰！”\n\n低语声此起彼伏，形成一阵压抑的集体抽气。奥德丽也感受到了同样的震撼，人类智慧的奇迹，前所未有的海上奇迹。\n\n贵族、大臣和下议院议员们花了不确定的时间才平复下来。就在这时，天空出现了一个黑点，逐渐变大，遮蔽了天空的三分之一，吸引了所有人的目光，也为现场投下了一片阴影。\n\n一只巨大的生物在空中漂浮飞行。它的线条极其流畅优雅，以深蓝色为基调。坚固的轻合金框架支撑着下方的气囊结构，腹部可见炮管、榴弹发射器和扁射炮的外壳。高能蒸汽引擎的嘈杂轰鸣和螺旋桨的疯狂旋转声，组成了令人敬畏的交响乐。\n\n皇家气球舰队抵达了，它的降临带着至高无上的威严。\n\n车厢两侧，“审判之剑”的徽记——一把镶嵌着红宝石王冠的垂直剑，反射着阳光。奥尔加斯家族的象征，传承自前一个时代。\n\n奥德丽尚未满十八岁，还未经历过“入会仪式”，那是由女王主持的正式社交活动，标志着成年。她只能在边缘观察，无法靠近。\n\n即便如此，她也毫不在意，甚至因为不必与王子们周旋而感到一丝轻松。\n\n人类飞行的奇迹降落在地面。年轻的卫兵们率先走出，身着红制服白裤子，手持步枪，笔直地站立，形成两列队伍，国王乔治三世及其家人，连同王子公主们陆续现身。\n\n奥德丽很少见到皇室成员，但她对此毫无兴趣。她的目光投向国王身旁那两位身披黑色铠甲的骑士，如同石像般肃立。\n\n在这个钢铁、蒸汽和火炮的时代，竟然还有全身披甲的人！\n\n冰冷的金属光泽，黑色头盔的深邃，散发着沉重、肃穆和不容置疑的服从感。\n\n“他们会不会是高阶的‘纪律骑士’……”奥德丽想起家族长辈们闲谈时的只言片语。好奇与敬畏交织，她却不敢靠得太近。\n\n随着王室的到来，仪式开始了。现任战争与海军大臣阿古赫·恩格走上前。\n\n一个保守派人物，至今仅有的两位非贵族首相之一，因卓越贡献被册封为子爵。\n\n但奥德丽知道得更多。他的兄长，保守党的中流砥柱，正是这一代的帕拉斯·恩格，公爵！\n\n阿古赫五十多岁，身形消瘦，有些秃顶，眼神锐利而犀利，扫视着人群。\n\n“女士们，先生们，”他开口道，声音充满威严，“你们已经看到了。这就是铁甲舰，能够改写历史航向的巨舰。全长：101米。宽度：21米。高度：围绕主甲板设计。主装甲带：457毫米厚。排水量：10060吨。四门305毫米主炮，前后布置。此外，六门速射炮，十八门6磅炮，以及四十六门六管机枪。四具鱼雷管。速度：最高16节！”\n\n“它将是海上无可争议的霸主！它将征服海洋！”\n\n贵族、大臣和议员们不安地骚动起来。即便是阿古赫的描述也描绘出可怕的景象，但亲眼所见更证实了这份恐惧。\n\n阿古赫嘴角泛起一丝若有若无的笑意。他又说了几句，然后向乔治三世国王鞠躬。\n\n“陛下，是时候为它命名了。”\n\n“就叫‘普里兹’吧，”国王宣布，脸上明显带着愉悦。\n\n“普里兹！”\n\n“普里兹！”\n\n这个名字传开，从大臣、海军参谋长，一路传到铁甲舰上的官兵，他们齐声欢呼。\n\n“欢迎普里兹！”\n\n庆祝活动爆发时，炮声齐鸣，回荡在空气中。乔治三世国王下令启航并进行测试。\n\n啊啊啊！\n汽笛长鸣，浓烟从烟囱中滚滚而出，机器的声响隐约可闻。\n\n巨兽移动了。当它驶出港口，用舰首炮向远处无人居住的岛屿开火时，所有人都倒吸一口凉气。\n\n轰！轰！轰！\n\n大地似乎在颤抖。尘土弥漫了空气。飓风般的大风席卷水面，将波涛搅得更加狂乱。\n\n阿古赫·恩格转过身，脸上带着满意的笑容。他对贵族、大臣和议员们说道。\n\n“从这一刻起，那七个自封的‘海盗将军’，那四个胆敢自称为王的家伙，只能颤抖着等待终结！”\n\n“他们的时代结束了。无论他们拥有何种‘非凡之力’，无论鬼船还是诅咒，海洋将由铁甲舰主宰！”\n\n就在这时，阿古赫的首席秘书故意插话。\n\n“但他们能自己造出这样的铁甲舰吗？”\n\n一些贵族和议员们默默点头，思考着可能性。\n\n阿古赫的笑容消失了，他缓缓摇头。\n\n“不。不可能。绝对不可能！建造这样的舰船需要三个大型煤钢一体化工厂，二十个特定规模的钢厂，六十个科学家以及无数来自贝尔恩军械研究所和普里兹造船研究所的资深工程师。需要两个皇家船坞及其关联的上百个零部件工厂，一个海军部，一个造船委员会，一个内阁，一位富有远见和决心的君主，以及一个每年能生产一千两百万吨钢铁的国家！”\n\n“他们永远做不到。”\n\n他停顿了一下，然后举起双臂，声音充满激情。\n\n“女士们，先生们，伟大的舰船和大炮的时代已经来临！”",

Institute”等专有名词的翻译一致性。回译中文在术语和整体风格上与初稿基本一致，但作为回译，其本身也应被视为一个翻译成品，可以考虑进一步优化其文学表现力。\n\n**最终决定:** PASS (翻译基本合格，但有改进空间，具体修改建议如上)",
  "final_translation": "\n**Chapter Title:** The Dawn of a New Era\n\n**English Draft:**\n\n**Part 1: The Tempest at Sea**\n\nAaaah!\nThe wind howled, the rain fell in torrents, the three-masted ship surged between wave after wave, cresting and plunging, tossed like a toy by the giants of the sea.\n\nAlgernon Wilson’s eyes, once shadowed with a deep, unnerving red, seemed to fade, leaving him still standing on the deck, unchanged from before.\n\nThen, he witnessed the peculiar glass bottle in his hand, grotesque in shape, shatter with a crisp *crack*. Frost, snow-like, melted into water, mingling with the raindrops.\n\nIn mere seconds, the ancient artifact was utterly gone, leaving no trace of its former existence.\n\nA shard of crystalline snow, hexagonal in form, appeared in Algernon’s palm. It rapidly dissipated, vanishing as if receding into the flesh itself.\n\nAlgernon nodded almost imperceptibly, as if pondering something profound. He remained utterly still for five long minutes.\n\nTurning his body, he walked towards the ship’s cabin entrance. Just as he was about to enter, he met a man stepping out, clad in a robe adorned with electric blue lightning patterns.\n\nThe man with the soft, honey-blonde hair paused, his gaze fixed on Algernon. He extended his right hand, fist clenched over his chest.\n\n\"Storm with you.\"\n\nAlgernon’s face, rugged and profound, devoid of any extraneous emotion, mirrored the gesture, clenching his own right fist over his left breast.\n\nAfter exchanging formal greetings, Algernon entered the cabin, moving down the passageway towards the captain’s quarters beyond.\n\nThroughout his journey, he encountered no sailors or crewmen. The ship was unnervingly silent, as still and empty as the interior of a tomb.\n\nThe captain’s door opened, revealing a plush, deep-brown carpet. Bookshelves and a liquor cabinet lined the sides. Yellowed bookbindings and dark, crimson wine bottles gleamed with an otherworldly light under the flickering candlelight.\n\nOn the candlelit desk sat an inkwell, a quill pen, a black metal telescope, and a brass sextant.\n\nBehind the desk, a middle-aged man, pale-faced, wearing a skull captain’s hat, watched Algernon approach. His lips curled in fury as he ground his teeth.\n\n\"I will not yield!\"\n\n\"You can do it,\" Algernon replied, his voice calm as if commenting on the day’s weather.\n\n\"You...\" The man froze, utterly unprepared for such a response.\n\nIn that instant, Algernon’s body tensed, and he lunged forward, closing the distance between them to mere inches.\n\n*Crack!*\n\nHis shoulder tightened, and his right hand shot out, clamping onto the man’s throat before he could react.\n\nPhantomscales shimmered on his hand, and his fingers flexed with terrifying strength.\n\n*Clink!*\n\nWith a sharp sound, the man’s eyes widened in shock as he was lifted entirely off his feet.\n\nHis legs thrashed violently, but his expression quickly settled into a blank stare. His pupils dilated, and the area beneath his trousers began to dampen, accompanied by a foul stench.\n\nAlgernon hoisted the man, bent his back, and took a stride towards the wall beside him.\n\n*Thump!* He used the man as a shield, slamming him forcefully against the forward wall.\n\nThe wooden panels splintered and shattered. The狂暴的风雨, carrying the briny tang of the sea, surged into the cabin.\n\nAlgernon twisted his torso, and with a throw, he sent the man crashing out of the cabin and into the churning sea, cresting wave upon cresting wave.\n\nDarkness, howling wind, and the raw power of nature swallowed everything.\n\nAlgernon pulled out a white handkerchief, wiped his right palm clean, and then tossed it into the sea.\n\nStepping back, he waited patiently for his companion to enter.\n\n\"What happened?\" Within seconds, the man with the honey-blonde hair burst in.\n\n\"The Captain... escaped,\" Algernon panted, his tone tinged with frustration. \"He still retains some...非凡之力!\"\n\n\"Damn it!\" The blonde man cursed under his breath.\n\nHe moved to the breach in the wall, staring intently into the distance. But all he saw was wind, rain, and the churning sea.\n\n\"Let it be,\" the blonde man waved a dismissive hand. \"He was merely an incidental. Finding this Tudor ghost ship is our gain.\"\n\nEven for a favored servant of the sea, he dared not risk venturing into the water in this weather.\n\n\"And if the storm continues,\" Algernon nodded, noting the visible, almost animate repair of the wooden wall. \"The Captain won’t last much longer.\"\n\nHe cast a sidelong glance, his head twisting instinctively towards the helm and the sails.\n\nThrough layers of wood, he could perceive their state.\n\nNo first mate. No second mate. No sailors. No ordinary seamen. Not a single living soul.\n\nThe helm and sails adjusted themselves, silently and unnervingly.\n\nA vision of the man obscured by grey and white mist, \"The Fool,\" flashed in his mind. Algernon sighed, a sound of weary resignation.\n\nHe turned to the raging storm outside, his voice a fragmented whisper, laced with both anticipation and dread.\n\n\"A new era has begun...\"\n\n**Part 2: The Heart of the City**\n\nIn the Queen's Quarter, the capital of Loen Kingdom, Backlund, Audrye Holl nipped her cheek, unable to fathom what had just transpired.\n\nBefore her, the antique copper mirror on her dressing table lay in shattered fragments.\n\nLowering her gaze, Audrye saw the \"Deep Red\" flowing across her hand, like a tattoo of stars.\n\nThe \"Deep Red\" gradually faded, vanishing beneath her skin.\n\nOnly then did Audrye confirm that she was not dreaming.\n\nHer eyes flickered with a liquid light, her lips curved slowly upwards. She stood, bending to gather her skirts.\n\nWith a curtsey to the empty air, Audrye moved with light steps, her body turning fluidly. She danced the \"Ancient Elven Dance,\" the latest宫廷流行舞, a radiant smile blooming on her face.\n\n*Tap-tap-tap!* The door to her room was knocked upon.\n\n\"Who is it?\" Audrye stopped abruptly, assuming a demure posture.\n\n\"Miss, may I enter? It is time for you to prepare,\" her lady’s maid asked from outside the door.\n\nAudrye glanced sideways at the broken mirror, quickly suppressing her smile, leaving only a faint line.\n\nShe examined herself left and right, satisfied with her appearance, then spoke softly.\n\n\"Enter.\"\n\nTwisting her wrist, her lady’s maid, Annie, pushed the door open.\n\n\"Oh, it’s shattered…\" Annie immediately noticed the state of the antique mirror.\n\nAudrye blinked, her voice slow and deliberate.\n\n\"Well, yes, um, Susie was here, you know. It just… likes to break things!\" Susie was a large, golden retriever with less than pure lineage, a gift from her father, Baron Holl, while hunting foxes, but dearly loved by Audrye.\n\n\"You need to discipline her properly,\" Annie said, expertly cleaning up the mirror shards, careful not to cut her mistress.\n\nFinished, she looked at Audrye, a small smile playing on her lips.\n\n\"What dress would you like?\"\n\n\"Ah, the one designed by Mistress Ginny for my seventeenth birthday,\" Audrye replied, thinking.\n\n\"No, that’s impossible. If someone were to see you wearing it again in a formal occasion, they would question the Holl family’s financial stability!\" Annie shook her head.\n\n\"But I truly adore it,\" Audrye insisted, her tone gentle.\n\n\"You can wear it at home, in less formal settings,\" Annie stated firmly.\n\n\"Then the one Sir Sedus brought yesterday, the one with the lace at the sleeves,\" Audrye said, holding her breath, maintaining her elegant, sweet smile.\n\n\"You always have such excellent taste,\" Annie smiled, stepping back towards the door. \"Number Six wardrobe, never mind, I’ll get it myself.\"\n\nThe maids sprang into action. One took charge of the gown, another of the jewels, another of the shoes, another of the silk hat, one for dressing Audrye, and one for considering the hairstyle.\n\nAs preparations wound down, the Baron, wearing a dark brown waistcoat and matching hat, with neatly trimmed sideburns, appeared at the doorway. His sapphire eyes held a cheerful glint, though the loose muscles, protruding belly, and deepening法令 lines marred the handsome man he once was.\n\n\"The jewel of Backlund, it is time to depart,\" Baron Holl announced, standing at the entrance, lightly tapping the open door.\n\n\"Father, please do not call me that,\" Audrye said, rising with her maid’s assistance, feigning a touch of vexation.\n\n\"Then, my lovely princess, it is time to go,\" the Baron bent his left arm, gesturing for her to take his arm.\n\nAudrye offered a faint smile and shook her head.\n\n\"This is Lady Holl, your mother. Her place.\"\n\n\"Then this way,\" the Baron smiled, bending his right arm. \"This is the pride of a father.\"\n\n**Part 3: The Ironclad and the Age of Steam**\n\nWhen Audrye, arm-in-arm with her father, descended from the carriage at Priz Port, Oak Island, Royal Naval Base, she was struck dumb by the behemoth before her.\n\nIn the nearby harbor lay a vessel of staggering proportions, its entire body shimmering with metallic glory. Gone were the sails, replaced by two towering smokestacks and two open-air gun turrets, one forward, one aft. It stood majestic, immense, dwarfing the nearby sailing battleships, which looked like mere children beside its colossus.\n\n\"By the storm...\"\n\n\"Oh, my God.\"\n\n\"Ironclad!\"\n\nThe murmurs rose, a low, collective gasp. Audrye felt the same awe, the wonder of human ingenuity, a miracle of the sea unlike any before.\n\nIt took an indeterminate time for the nobles, ministers, and members of the House of Commons to regain their composure. Just then, a black dot appeared in the sky, growing larger, blotting out a third of the heavens, commanding all attention and casting a sudden pall over the scene.\n\nA colossal creature drifted and flew through the air. Its lines were incredibly fluid and elegant, painted in deep blue. A sturdy, light alloy frame supported the fabric housing airbags below, with casings for cannons, grenade launchers, and flat-trajectory guns visible on its underbelly. The cacophony of high-spirit steam engines and the frantic whirring of the propellers formed a symphony of awe-inspiring power.\n\nThe royal family’s airship had arrived, its descent marked by an air of supreme authority.\n\nOn either side of the carriage compartment, the \"Judgment Sword\" emblem, a vertical sword set with a ruby crown, reflected the sunlight. A symbol of the Augusta family, its legacy stretching back to the previous era.\n\nAudrye, not yet eighteen, had not undergone the \"Introduction Ceremony,\" the formal entry into Backlund’s social scene presided over by the Queen, signifying her adulthood. She could only observe from the sidelines, unable to approach.\n\nStill, she paid it little mind, even feeling a sense of relief at not having to mingle with the princes.\n\nThe \"miracle\" of human flight settled onto the ground. First out climbed youthful guardsmen, clad in red uniforms and white trousers, bearing rifles, standing at rigid attention, forming two ranks as King George III and his family, along with the princes and princesses, emerged.\n\nAudrye hadn’t seen royalty often, but she showed no interest. Her gaze drifted to the two black-armored knights standing beside the monarch, like stone statues.\n\nIn this age of steel, steam, and artillery, there were still men clad head-to-toe in armor!\n\nThe cold gleam of the metal, the deep black of the helmets, radiated a sense of weight, solemnity, and unquestioning obedience.\n\n\"Could they be the higher-tier 'Disciplinarian Knights'...\" Audrye thought of idle conversations among her family’s elders. Curious, yet daunted, she dared not come closer.\n\nWith the king’s family arrived, the ceremony began. Lord Agughe Ngen, the current Secretary of State for War and the Navy, stepped forward.\n\nA conservative figure, one of only two non-noble prime ministers to date, he had been elevated to Lord for his exceptional contributions.\n\nBut Audrye knew more. His elder brother, the mainstay of the Conservatives, was Lord Palas Ngen, the Duke of this generation!\n\nAgughe, in his late fifties, thin and somewhat balding, with sharp, piercing eyes, surveyed the crowd.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he began, his voice resonating with authority. \"You have seen it. This is an ironclad, a vessel capable of overturning the tides of history. Length: 101 meters. Beam: 21 meters. Height: Designed around the main deck. Main armor belt: 457mm thick. Displacement: 10,060 tons. Four 305mm main guns, forward and aft. Additionally, six rapid-fire guns, eighteen 6-pounders, and forty-six six-barreled machine guns. Four torpedo tubes. Speed: Up to 16 knots!\"\n\n\"It shall be the undisputed master of the waves! It shall conquer the sea!\"\n\nNobleman, ministers, and parliamentarians stirred uneasily. Even Agughe’s description painted a terrifying picture, but the sight of the vessel itself confirmed the horror.\n\nA faint smile touched Agughe’s lips. He delivered a few more words before bowing to King George III.\n\n\"Majesty, it is time to name it.\"\n\n\"It shall be called 'Priz',\" the King announced, his expression clearly pleased.\n\n\"Priz!\"\n\n\"Priz!\"\n\nThe name spread, passed from the Secretary of State, the Chief of the Naval Staff, onwards, until it reached the officers and men aboard the ironclad, who cheered in unison.\n\n\"Hail Priz!\"\n\nAs celebrations erupted, salvos of artillery echoed through the air. King George III gave the order for departure and trials.\n\nAaaah!\nThe whistle blew, thick smoke billowed from the funnels, the sounds of machinery faintly audible.\n\nThe leviathan moved. As it cleared the port and opened fire on an uninhabited island ahead with its bow-mounted guns, everyone present gasped.\n\n*BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!*\n\nThe earth seemed to tremble. Dust choked the air. A hurricane-force wind whipped across the water, tossing the waves into a frenzy.\n\nAgughe Ngen turned, a satisfied smile on his face. He addressed the nobles, ministers, and parliamentarians.\n\n\"From this moment forth, those seven self-styled 'Generals' of piracy, those four who dared to usurp the title of King, can only tremble, awaiting their end!\"\n\n\"Their era is over. No matter what 'extraordinary power' they may possess, no matter the ghost ships or curses, the sea shall be dominated by the ironclad!\"\n\nJust then, Agughe’s chief secretary interjected deliberately.\n\n\"But can they build such an ironclad themselves?\"\n\nSome nobles and members of parliament nodded silently, considering the possibility.\n\nAgughe’s smile vanished, replaced by a slow shake of his head.\n\n\"No. Impossible. Utterly impossible! To construct such a vessel requires three large coal-steel integrated plants, twenty steelworks of a certain scale, the expertise of sixty scientists and countless senior engineers from the Backlund Ordnance Research Institute and the Priz Shipbuilding Research Institute. It demands two Royal Dockyards and their associated hundred-plus component factories, a Ministry of the Navy, a shipbuilding committee, a cabinet, a visionary and resolute monarch, and a nation capable of producing twelve million tons of steel annually!\"\n\n\"They will never achieve it.\"\n\nHe paused, then raised his arms, his voice booming with fervor.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, the age of the great ship and the great gun has dawned!\"",
