  "draft": "\nOkay, here is the English draft for Chapter 2, Part 1, adhering to the specified style and glossary:\n\n**Chapter 2: Situation**\n\n**Chunk 1**\n\n*Thump-thump-thump!*\n\nZhou Mingri recoiled, staggering back several steps. The sight before him was so shocking that it seemed the reflection in the穿衣镜 wasn't of himself, but of a dried-up corpse.\n\nA person with such grievous wounds could not possibly be alive!\n\nDisbelieving, he tilted his head again, checking the other side, even though the distance increased and the image blurred. Yet, even with the diminished clarity, the贯穿 wounds and the crimson bloodstains remained undeniable.\n\n\"Th…\"\nTaking a deep breath, Zhou Mingri forced himself to calm down.\nHe reached out and pressed his hand firmly against his left chest, feeling the heart beneath leap and throb, strong and vigorous.\nThen he touched the skin exposed by his shirt, feeling a faint coolness beneath which flowed a warmth.\nSquatting down, he tested the flexibility of his knee before standing up again. The frantic edge had lessened.\n\"What in the name of—?\" He frowned, whispering to himself, intending to examine the head wound more thoroughly.\nTaking two steps forward, he paused abruptly. The light from the blood moon outside seemed too dim, insufficient for a proper inspection.\n\nA fragment of memory surged unexpectedly. Zhou Mingri turned his head towards the wall beside his desk, where a gas lamp was enclosed within a frame of grey pipes and metal grilles.\nThis was the current standard gaslight, its flame steady, its illumination excellent.\nConsidering the circumstances of his predecessor, Celenne Morty, acquiring even a kerosene lamp would have been stretching the truth; candles were the expected fare for someone of his station. Yet, four years prior, while Celenne had studied late into the night, preparing for the Khoy University entrance examinations, his brother, Benson, believing it crucial for the family's future, had insisted on providing the necessary conditions, even borrowing money.\nOf course, Benson, literate and working for several years, was far from reckless, lacking in guile, or failing to consider the consequences. He had persuaded the landlord, Mr. French, to undertake the basic pipe installation by arguing that \"installing gas pipes would enhance the apartment's prestige and aid in future rentals.\" And himself, leveraging his employment with an import/export company, had secured nearly cost-price gas lamps. In the end, he had managed it all with his savings alone, without borrowing from anyone.\n\nThe memory fragment flickered past. Zhou Mingri returned to his desk, opening the valve on the pipe, then flicking the gas lamp switch.\n*Click-click-click,* the friction-igniting mechanism clicked several times, but the expected light did not manifest as he had anticipated.\n*Click-click-click!* He flicked the switch again, but the gaslight remained stubbornly dim.\n\n\"Hmm…\" Shrinking his hand back, he pressed his left temple, drawing upon the fragmented memories to seek a cause.\nSeconds later, he turned his body and walked towards the door, heading for the identical mechanical contraption mounted on the wall next to it, connected by the same grey pipes.\nIt was the gas meter!\n\nGlancing at the exposed gears and bearings, Zhou Mingri reached into his trouser pocket.\nThe coin he pulled out was a dull yellow, gleaming with copper lustre. The obverse bore the portrait of a man wearing a crown, the reverse featured wheat ears crowning the number \"1\".\n\nZhou Mingri knew this was the most basic currency of the Loen Kingdom, called a Penny. A Penny's purchasing power was roughly equivalent to three or four yuan before his arrival. There were also halfpennies and farthings, but they were still coarse denominations, often necessitating rounding up for everyday transactions.\nAfter letting the George III penny he held rotate several times in his fingers, he rubbed it and inserted it into the vertical, slit-like \"mouth\" of the gas meter.\n\n*Jingle-jangle!*\nAs the penny fell into the meter's interior, the sound of creaking gears immediately followed, playing a short, melodious mechanical tune.\n\nHe gazed for a few seconds, then returned to his desk, reaching out to flick the gas lamp switch again.\n*Click-click-click, thump!*\nA flame sprang up, rapidly growing larger. The bright light first filled the lamp globe, then spilled through the clear glass, bathing the room in a warm, almost inviting glow.\n\nDarkness recoiled sharply. Crimson relinquished its hold on the window. Zhou Mingri felt an inexplicable sense of reassurance wash over him. He hurried to the穿衣镜.\nThis time, he scrutinized his temple meticulously, not missing a single detail.\nAfter careful comparison, he found that aside from the initial bloodstains, the horrifying wound showed no further signs of bleeding. It seemed blessed with excellent haemostasis and bandaging. And the sluggish, creeping grey matter of the brain, coupled with the visibly knitting flesh of the wound, signalled the approach of healing. Perhaps in thirty or forty minutes, maybe two or three hours, only a faint mark would remain.\n\n\"Curative effects from the transition?\" Zhou Mingri quirked the corner of his right mouth, whispering silently.\nHe took a long, slow breath. Regardless of the cause, at least he was still very much alive!\nCentering himself, he pulled out a small block of soap, took a worn towel hanging beside the cabinet, and selected one of them. Then, he opened the door and headed towards the second-floor common washroom for tenants.\n\nHmm, the bloodstains on his head needed attending to. He couldn't afford to look like a crime scene at every glance. It was bad enough if it scared himself, but if it frightened Melissa tomorrow morning, when she had to get up early for work, that would be a disaster indeed!\nThe hallway outside was pitch black, only the faint, crimson moonlight filtering through the window at the far end barely outlining the shapes protruding from the darkness, making them resemble countless monstrous eyes silently observing the living.\nZhou Mingri lightened his footsteps, moving with a nervous tension towards the washroom.\n\nOnce inside, the moonlight was stronger, illuminating everything clearly. He stood before the sink and turned on the tap.\n*Faucet water sound,* the noise entered his ears, and suddenly he recalled Mr. French, the landlord.\nAs water rates were included in the rent, the short, stout, thin man, perpetually wearing his top hat, waistcoat, and black formal coat, often bustled by to inspect the washrooms, listening intently for the sound of running water.\nIf the noise was particularly loud, Mr. French would disregard his gentlemanly decorum, furiously brandishing his walking stick, pounding on the washroom door, and shouting, \"Damn thieves!\" \"Waste is a sin!\" \"I'll remember this!\" \"Let me catch you doing it again, and you can pack your dirty bags and get out!\" \"Believe me, this is the most reasonably priced apartment in Tingen City. You won't find a more generous landlord than me!\"\n\nShaking his head clear, Zhou Mingri wet the towel and began washing the bloodstains from his face, repeating the action several times.\nAfter checking himself in the dilapidated washroom mirror, confirming that only the狰狞伤口 and pale face remained, Zhou Mingri felt a significant weight lift from his shoulders. He then removed his linen shirt and used the soap to scrub the bloodstains from his torso.\nJust then, his brow furrowed. A new worry occurred to him:\nThe injuries were dramatic, the blood abundant. Besides himself, the room itself must be stained!\nAfter a few minutes, Zhou Mingri had cleaned his shirt. Holding the damp towel, he hurried back home. First, he wiped the bloodstains from his hands on the desk. Then, relying on the gas lamp's light, he searched for other traces.\nHis search yielded results almost immediately. There were numerous splatter stains on the floor and under the desk. And, on the left wall, near the floor, lay a single, bright yellow bullet casing.\n\n\"...Shot himself in the temple with a revolver?\" The disparate clues suddenly connected in his mind. Zhou Mingri guessed the cause of Celenne's death.\nHe didn't rush to verify this immediately. First, he meticulously cleaned the bloodstains, tidied up the \"scene,\" before picking up the casing and returning to his desk. He opened the revolver's cylinder and ejected the cartridges within.\n*Clickety-clack,* five bullets and one empty casing lay there, gleaming with brass.\n\n\"Indeed…\" Zhou Mingri glanced at the empty casing, nodding slightly as he carefully reloaded each bullet into the cylinder.\nHis gaze shifted left, falling upon the open notebook where the words \"All men must die, including me\" were written. More questions churned within him.\nWhere did the gun come from?\nSuicide, or a staged suicide?\nWhat could have befallen a history graduate from a commoner family?\nHow did this method of suicide leave so little blood? Was it because his timely transition granted him some inherent healing?\nHe pondered for a moment, then changed into another linen shirt and sat down in the chair, contemplating the truly crucial matters.\nCelenne's situation, while unfortunate, wasn't his primary concern. The real question was figuring out *why* he had transitioned and whether he could return!\n\nParents, relatives, friends, the lively online world, the variety of delicious food... These were all things he desperately wished to reclaim!\n*Click, click, click...* Zhou Mingri's right hand absently spun the revolver cylinder, then snapped it shut, repeating the action.\n\"Hmm, things haven't been drastically different from usual, just... unlucky. How could I suddenly transition without any warning?\"\n\"Bad luck... Wait a minute, I performed a luck charm before dinner tonight!\"\nA bolt of lightning flashed through his mind, illuminating the foggy memories obscured by the transition.\nAs a self-proclaimed \"jack of all trades\" in keyboard politics, history, economics, biology, and folklore, he was often derided by his friends as \"a master of only a little bit of everything.\"\nAnd among these \"trades,\" occult arts were included.\nLast year, returning to his hometown, he'd found an old, bound, vertical edition \"Secret Transmission of Formulas and Techniques from the Qin and Han Dynasties.\" Finding it intriguing, thinking it might help him \"win arguments\" online, he'd bought it. Unfortunately, his interest had faded quickly; the vertical script was difficult to read, and he'd only flipped through the beginning before shelving the book in the corner.\nNow, after a string of misfortunes in the past month – losing his phone, a client backing out, a work error – he'd randomly remembered the luck charm mentioned at the start of the \"Secret Transmission\" book. It required nothing more than simple materials.\nWith nothing to lose, he retrieved the book, followed the instructions, and performed the ritual before his dinner. But nothing happened then.\nUntil the middle of the night, when he had transitioned!\nHe *had* transitioned!\n\"It's a definite possibility that the luck charm was responsible... Hmm, I'll try performing it here tomorrow. If it was indeed the cause, then perhaps there's a way back!\" Zhou Mingri stopped spinning the revolver, sitting up straight.\nHe had to try, no matter what. Even a dead horse is worth riding for a chance at a cure!",
  "back_translation": "\n好的，这是您提供的英文段落按照要求回译成的中文：\n\n**第二章：状况**\n\n**片段一**\n\n*砰砰砰！*\n\n周明理（音译：Zhou Mingri）猛地后退几步，眼前的景象如此骇人，让他几乎以为穿衣镜中映出的不是自己，而是一具风干的尸体。\n\n一个伤势如此惨重的人，怎么可能还活着！\n\n他难以置信地再次歪过头，检查着另一侧，尽管距离拉远，影像已经模糊。然而，即便清晰度降低，贯穿伤和那刺目的血迹依然不容置疑。\n\n“呃…”\n周明理深吸一口气，强迫自己冷静下来。\n他伸手，坚定地按住自己的左胸，感觉到心脏在下方有力而蓬勃地跳动。\n然后他触摸着衬衫下露出的皮肤，感觉到下方有一丝微凉，但流动着暖意。\n他蹲下身，测试了一下膝盖的灵活性，然后站起身。那种濒临崩溃的边缘已经减弱了。\n“这是怎么回事——？”他皱起眉头，小声自语，打算更仔细地检查头部伤口。\n向前走了两步，他突然停住。窗外的血月光芒似乎太暗了，不足以进行仔细的检查。\n\n一段记忆碎片突然涌现。周明理转头望向书桌旁的墙壁，那里嵌着一盏煤气灯，被灰色的管道和金属格栅包围。\n这是目前标准的煤气灯，火焰稳定，照明效果很好。\n考虑到前任塞伦·莫蒂（音译：Celenne Morty）的情况，即使给他一盏煤油灯也是牵强；蜡烛才是他这个身份应有的照明。然而，四年前，当塞伦为了考科伊大学（音译：Khoy University）而熬夜苦读时，他的哥哥本森（音译：Benson）认为这对家庭未来至关重要，坚持要提供必要的条件，甚至借钱。\n当然，本森并非鲁莽之人，他受过良好教育，工作数年，远非缺乏心机或不计后果。他通过说服房东弗rench先生（音译：Mr. French）来安装基本的管道，理由是“安装煤气管道能提升公寓的声誉，有助于未来的出租”。而他自己，则凭借在进出口公司的职位，以接近成本的价格弄到了几盏煤气灯。最终，他仅凭自己的积蓄就完成了这一切，没有向任何人借钱。\n\n记忆碎片一闪而过。周明理回到书桌前，打开管道上的阀门，然后拨动煤气灯开关。\n*咔哒咔哒咔哒,* 摩擦点火装置响了几次，但正如他所预期的那样，预期的光芒并未出现。\n*咔哒咔哒咔哒!* 他又拨动了开关，但煤气灯顽固地保持昏暗。\n\n“嗯…”他缩回手，按住左太阳穴，借着记忆碎片寻找原因。\n几秒钟后，他转身走向门口，走向旁边墙上的那个相同构造的机械装置，同样由灰色管道连接。\n那是煤气表！\n\n瞥了一眼镜子中映出的狰狞伤口和苍白的脸庞，周明理觉得肩上的重负大大减轻了。然后他脱下细棉布衬衫，用肥皂搓洗身体上的血迹。\n就在这时，他皱起了眉头。一个新的担忧浮上心头：\n伤势惨烈，血迹丰富。除了他自己，这间屋子本身肯定也染上了血迹！\n几分钟后，周明理洗好了衬衫。他拿着湿毛巾匆匆回家。先是在书桌上擦掉手上的血迹。然后依靠煤气灯的光线，他搜寻其他痕迹。\n他的搜寻几乎立刻有了结果。地板和书桌下到处都是飞溅的血迹。而在左墙靠近地面的地方，静静地躺着一个亮黄色的子弹壳。\n\n“……是用左轮手枪对着太阳穴开的枪？”这些零散的线索在他脑海中突然串联起来。周明理推测了塞伦死亡的原因。\n他没有立刻去验证这一点。首先，他仔细清理了血迹，整理了“现场”，然后拿起子弹壳回到书桌前。他打开左轮手枪的弹巢，将里面的子弹弹出。\n*咔嗒咔嗒,* 五颗子弹和一个空弹壳躺在那里，闪着黄铜的光泽。\n\n“确实…”周明理瞥了一眼空弹壳，小心翼翼地将每颗子弹重新装入弹巢，点了点头。\n他的目光转向左边，落在摊开的笔记本上，上面写着“人皆有死，我亦有焉”。更多的疑问在他心中翻腾。\n枪是从哪里来的？\n是自杀，还是伪装的自杀？\n一个平民家庭出身的历史系毕业生，遭遇了什么？\n这种自杀方式为何留下的血迹如此之少？是因为他及时的“过渡”赋予了他某种固有的自愈能力吗？\n他思索片刻，换上另一件细棉布衬衫，坐在椅子上，思考真正关键的问题。\n塞伦的情况虽然不幸，但并非他的首要关切。真正的问题是弄清楚他为什么会“过渡”，以及是否能够回去！\n\n父母、亲戚、朋友、热闹的网络世界、各种美味的食物……这些都是他迫切想要夺回的东西！\n*咔哒，咔哒，咔哒...* 周明理的右手无意识地转动着左轮手枪的弹巢，然后“咔哒”一声合上，重复着这个动作。\n“嗯，情况并没有和平时差太多，只是……倒霉。我怎么会毫无征兆地突然‘过渡’呢？”\n“是坏运气……等等，今晚晚饭前我做了个幸运符！”一道闪电在他脑海中划过，照亮了被“过渡”模糊的记忆。\n作为一个自称在键盘上涉猎政治、历史、经济、生物和民俗学的“杂家”，他经常被朋友们嘲笑是“样样通，样样松”。\n而在这些“杂学”中，也包括了神秘学。\n去年，回到家乡时，他发现了一本旧的、竖排版的《秦汉度人经》。觉得有趣，想着或许能用它在网上“赢点争论”，他把它买了回来。可惜，他的兴趣很快就消退了；竖排文字难读，他只翻了翻前言就把书塞到了角落的书架上。\n现在，经历了过去一个月的一系列不幸——丢了手机，客户反悔，工作出错——他才随机想起了《秦汉度人经》前言里提到的那个幸运符。它只需要一些简单的材料。\n没什么可失去的了，他拿出那本书，按照说明做了仪式，就在晚饭前。但当时什么也没发生。\n直到午夜时分，他才“过渡”了！\n他确实“过渡”了！\n“幸运符肯定是有可能的……嗯，我明天在这里再试试。如果真的是它导致了‘过渡’，那么或许就还有回去的方法！”周明理停下转动弹巢的手，坐直了身体。\n他必须试一试，无论如何。就算是一具死马也得再骑一会儿，万一能治好呢！",

Yet, even with the diminished clarity, the贯穿 wounds and the crimson bloodstains remained undeniable.` 这基本传达了意思，但 `tilted his head again` 可以是 `tilted his head to the side` 或 `glanced at the other side`。`Yet, even with... remained undeniable` 可以更简洁，比如 `Yet, even with the image blurring, the贯穿 wounds and crimson bloodstains were still clear.` 或 `Despite the blurring image, the贯穿 wounds and crimson bloodstains were undeniable.`。\n    *   **\"这……\"**: 初稿翻译为 `\"Th…\"`，这是对原文 `“这……”` 的合理翻译，表示惊愕。\n    *   **\"努力让自己平静。\"**: 初稿翻译为 `forced himself to calm down.` 这里的 `forced` 可以考虑 `tried to calm himself down` 或 `made an effort to calm down`，但 `forced` 也暗示了内心的挣扎，可以保留。\n    *   **\"心脏剧烈快速又生机勃勃的跳动。\"**: 初稿翻译为 `feeling the heart beneath leap and throb, strong and vigorous.` 这里 `leap and throb` 很好地传达了跳动的感觉，`strong and vigorous` 也准确表达了“生机勃勃”。可以保留。\n    *   **\"些微的冰凉掩盖下是温热的流淌。\"**: 初稿翻译为 `feeling a faint coolness beneath which flowed a warmth.` 这基本正确，但 `flowed a warmth` 可以是 `flowed warmth` 或 `felt warm beneath the faint coolness`。\n    *   **\"狰狞的伤口并没有再流出液体。\"**: 初稿翻译为 `the horrifying wound showed no further signs of bleeding.` 这里的 `bleeding` 是准确的，但原文是“流出液体”，虽然语境下是血液，但 `showing no further signs of bleeding` 比 `流出液体` 更直接地对应了“不再出血”的意思。\n    *   **\"以肉眼可见速度生长的创口血肉\"**: 初稿翻译为 `the visibly knitting flesh of the wound`，`knitting` 是一个很好的比喻，表示缝合/愈合，可以保留。\n    *   **\"Curative effects from the transition?\"**: 初稿翻译为 `\"Curative effects from the transition?\"`，这直接引用了主角的疑问，但英文中 `transition` 作为动词时，其效果通常说 `effects of the transition` 或 `benefits from the transition`。可以改为 `\"The healing effects from the transition?\"` 或 `\"Did the transition grant me healing?\"`。\n    *   **\"不管因为什么，至少自己还是个活人！\"**: 初稿翻译为 `Regardless of the cause, at least he was still very much alive!` 这基本正确，但 `very much` 可以省略，`at least he was still alive!` 已经足够强调。\n    *   **\"狰狞伤口和苍白的脸庞\"**: 初稿翻译为 `the狰狞伤口 and pale face remaining`，这里 `remaining` 可能暗示“仍然存在”，但结合上下文，是指“只剩下这些”，可以改为 `the only remaining狰狞伤口 and pale face`。\n    *   **\"沾上的血点\"**: 初稿翻译为 `scrub the bloodstains from his torso`，`bloodstains` 比 `blood spots` 更常用。\n    *   **\"黄澄澄的子弹头\"**: 初稿翻译为 `a single, bright yellow bullet casing`，`bright yellow` 很好地传达了“黄澄澄”的颜色，`bullet casing` 是标准术语。\n    *   **\"空弹壳\"**: 初稿翻译为 `empty casing`，可以保留。\n    *   **\"人皆有死，包括我\"**: 初稿翻译为 `All men must die, including me`，这是对原句 `所有人都会死，包括我` 的标准翻译，可以保留。\n    *   **\"一个平民出生的历史系毕业生\"**: 初稿翻译为 `a history graduate from a commoner family`，`commoner family` 是合适的。\n    *   **\"死马也得当成活马医\"**: 初稿翻译为 `Even a dead horse is worth riding for a chance at a cure!` 这是一个意译，传达了“死马当活马医”的意思，但英文中更常见的表达是 `Even if it's a dead horse, it's worth trying` 或 `Even a dead horse is worth a try`。可以考虑 `Even if it's a lost cause, it's worth a try!` 或 `He had to try, no matter how slim the chances.`\n\n3.  **细节与流畅性：**\n    *   **煤气灯描述:** 初稿对煤气灯的描述基本准确，但可以更流畅地连接上下文。例如，关于克莱恩家庭情况的描述，`Considering the circumstances of his predecessor, Celenne Morty...` 可以改为 `Thinking of his predecessor, Celenne Morty...` 或 `Recalling his predecessor's situation...`。\n    *   **煤气灯操作:** 初稿的 `*Click-click-click,* the friction-igniting mechanism clicked several times, but the expected light did not manifest as he had anticipated.` 这里 `manifest` 可以改为 `appear` 或 `come on`。`*Click-click-click!* He flicked the switch again, but the gaslight remained stubbornly dim.` `stubbornly dim` 是一个不错的表达，可以保留。\n    *   **房东弗兰奇先生:** 初稿对房东的描述很生动，但 `perpetually wearing his top hat, waistcoat, and black formal coat` 可以简化为 `always dressed in his top hat, waistcoat, and formal coat`。`disregard his gentlemanly decorum` 可以是 `ignore his usual gentlemanly demeanor`。\n    *   **\"哗啦啦，水声入耳\"**: 初稿翻译为 `*Faucet water sound,* the noise entered his ears`，可以改为 `The sound of running water filled his ears`。\n    *   **\"飞溅出的血点\"**: 初稿翻译为 `numerous splatter stains`，`splatter stains` 是合适的。\n    *   **\"克莱恩的遭遇\"**: 初稿翻译为 `Celenne's situation`，需要统一为 `Celenne Morty's situation` 或 `the previous tenant's situation`。\n    *   **\"过渡\"**: 初稿翻译为 `transition`，这是对 `穿越` 的指定术语 `穿越` → `transition` (domain_term)。需要全文统一使用 `transition`。\n    *   **\"幸运符\"**: 初稿翻译为 `luck charm`，这是对 `转运仪式` 的一种说法，可以接受。\n    *   **\"咔哒咔哒\"**: 初稿翻译为 `*Clickety-clack,* five bullets and one empty casing lay there, gleaming with brass.` 这里 `Clickety-clack` 描述了子弹的撞击声，可以保留。\n    *   **\"咔哒\"**: 初稿翻译为 `*Click, click, click...*` 描述转动弹巢的声音，可以保留。\n    *   **\"砰砰砰！\"**: 再次确认，`*Thump-thump-thump!*` 或 `*Ding-ding-ding!*` 或 `*Clang-clang-clang!*`，需要根据具体语境选择。`*Thump-thump-thump!*` 最接近“蹬蹬蹬”的地面感。\n\n**总结：**\n\n*   **核心问题：** `Celenne Morty` 的译名与强制术语表冲突，需要优先修正。`Zhou Mingrui` 的拼写错误需要修正。`transition` 需要全文统一。\n*   **风格问题：** 需要调整一些描述性词语，使其更符合原文的神秘、压抑基调，并确保比喻和意象的准确性。\n*   **流畅性：** 需要调整一些句子结构，使其更自然流畅。\n\n请根据以上建议修改英文初稿。如果修改后仍符合您的高标准，请回复 `PASS`。",
  "final_translation": "\nOkay, here is the revised English translation with corrected terminology, focusing on the specific issue raised and ensuring consistency for the mentioned terms:\n\n**Chapter 2: Situation**\n\n**Chunk 1**\n\n*Thump-thump-thump!*\n\nZhou Mingrui recoiled, staggering back several steps. The sight before him was so shocking that it seemed the reflection in the **穿衣镜** (clothing mirror) wasn't of himself, but of a dried-up corpse.\n\nA person with such grievous wounds could not possibly be alive!\n\nDisbelieving, he tilted his head again, checking the other side, even though the distance increased and the image blurred. Yet, even with the diminished clarity, the **贯穿** wounds and the crimson bloodstains remained undeniable.\n\n\"Th…\"\nTaking a deep breath, Zhou Mingrui forced himself to calm down.\nHe reached out and pressed his hand firmly against his left chest, feeling the heart beneath leap and throb, strong and vigorous.\nThen he touched the skin exposed by his shirt, feeling a faint coolness beneath which flowed a warmth.\nSquatting down, he tested the flexibility of his knee before standing up again. The frantic edge had lessened.\n\"What in the name of—?\" He frowned, whispering to himself, intending to examine the head wound more thoroughly.\nTaking two steps forward, he paused abruptly. The light from the blood moon outside seemed too dim, insufficient for a proper inspection.\n\nA fragment of memory surged unexpectedly. Zhou Mingrui turned his head towards the wall beside his desk, where a gas lamp was enclosed within a frame of grey pipes and metal grilles.\nThis was the current standard gaslight, its flame steady, its illumination excellent.\nConsidering the circumstances of his predecessor, **克莱恩·莫雷蒂** (Celenne Morty), acquiring even a kerosene lamp would have been stretching the truth; candles were the expected fare for someone of his station. Yet, four years prior, while **克莱恩·莫雷蒂** (Celenne Morty) had studied late into the night, preparing for the Khoy University entrance examinations, his brother, **班森** (Benson), believing it crucial for the family's future, had insisted on providing the necessary conditions, even borrowing money.\nOf course, **班森** (Benson), literate and working for several years, was far from reckless, lacking in guile, or failing to consider the consequences. He had persuaded the landlord, Mr. French, to undertake the basic pipe installation by arguing that \"installing gas pipes would enhance the apartment's prestige and aid in future rentals.\" And himself, leveraging his employment with an import/export company, had secured nearly cost-price gas lamps. In the end, he had managed it all with his savings alone, without borrowing from anyone.\n\nThe memory fragment flickered past. Zhou Mingrui returned to his desk, opening the valve on the pipe, then flicking the gas lamp switch.\n*Click-click-click,* the friction-igniting mechanism clicked several times, but the expected light did not manifest as he had anticipated.\n*Click-click-click!* He flicked the switch again, but the gaslight remained stubbornly dim.\n\n\"Hmm…\" Shrinking his hand back, he pressed his left temple, drawing upon the fragmented memories to seek a cause.\nSeconds later, he turned his body and walked towards the door, heading for the identical mechanical contraption mounted on the wall next to it, connected by the same grey pipes.\nIt was the **瓦斯计费器** (gas meter)!\n\nGlancing at the exposed gears and bearings, Zhou Mingrui reached into his trouser pocket.\nThe coin he pulled out was a dull yellow, gleaming with copper lustre. The obverse bore the portrait of a man wearing a crown, the reverse featured wheat ears crowning the number \"1\".\n\nZhou Mingrui knew this was the most basic currency of the **鲁恩王国** (Loen Kingdom), called a **便士** (Penny). A Penny's purchasing power was roughly equivalent to three or four yuan before his arrival. There were also **半便士** (halfpennies) and **四分之一便士** (farthings), but they were still coarse denominations, often necessitating rounding up for everyday transactions.\nAfter letting the George III penny he held rotate several times in his fingers, he rubbed it and inserted it into the vertical, slit-like \"mouth\" of the gas meter.\n\n*Jingle-jangle!*\nAs the penny fell into the meter's interior, the sound of creaking gears immediately followed, playing a short, melodious mechanical tune.\n\nHe gazed for a few seconds, then returned to his desk, reaching out to flick the gas lamp switch again.\n*Click-click-click, thump!*\nA flame sprang up, rapidly growing larger. The bright light first filled the lamp globe, then spilled through the clear glass, bathing the room in a warm, almost inviting glow.\n\nDarkness recoiled sharply. Crimson relinquished its hold on the window. Zhou Mingrui felt an inexplicable sense of reassurance wash over him. He hurried to the **穿衣镜** (clothing mirror).\nThis time, he scrutinized his temple meticulously, not missing a single detail.\nAfter careful comparison, he found that aside from the initial bloodstains, the horrifying wound showed no further signs of bleeding. It seemed blessed with excellent **止血** (haemostasis) and bandaging. And the sluggish, creeping grey matter of the brain, coupled with the visibly knitting flesh of the wound, signalled the approach of healing. Perhaps in thirty or forty minutes, maybe two or three hours, only a faint mark would remain.\n\n\"Curative effects from the transition?\" Zhou Mingrui quirked the corner of his right mouth, whispering silently.\nHe took a long, slow breath. Regardless of the cause, at least he was still very much alive!\nCentering himself, he pulled out a small block of soap, took a worn towel hanging beside the cabinet, and selected one of them. Then, he opened the door and headed towards the second-floor common washroom for tenants.\n\nHmm, the bloodstains on his head needed attending to. He couldn't afford to look like a crime scene at every glance. It was bad enough if it scared himself, but if it frightened Melissa tomorrow morning, when she had to get up early for work, that would be a disaster indeed!\nThe hallway outside was pitch black, only the faint, crimson moonlight filtering through the window at the far end barely outlining the shapes protruding from the darkness, making them resemble countless monstrous eyes silently observing the living.\nZhou Mingrui lightened his footsteps, moving with a nervous tension towards the washroom.\n\nOnce inside, the moonlight was stronger, illuminating everything clearly. He stood before the sink and turned on the tap.\n*Faucet water sound,* the noise entered his ears, and suddenly he recalled Mr. French, the landlord.\nAs water rates were included in the rent, the short, stout, thin man, perpetually wearing his top hat, waistcoat, and black formal coat, often bustled by to inspect the washrooms, listening intently for the sound of running water.\nIf the noise was particularly loud, Mr. French would disregard his gentlemanly decorum, furiously brandishing his walking stick, pounding on the washroom door, and shouting, \"Damn thieves!\" \"Waste is a sin!\" \"I'll remember this!\" \"Let me catch you doing it again, and you can pack your dirty bags and get out!\" \"Believe me, this is the most reasonably priced apartment in Tingen City. You won't find a more generous landlord than me!\"\n\nShaking his head clear, Zhou Mingrui wet the towel and began washing the bloodstains from his face, repeating the action several times.\nAfter checking himself in the dilapidated washroom mirror, confirming that only the **狰狞伤口** (horrifying wound) and pale face remained, Zhou Mingrui felt a significant weight lift from his shoulders. He then removed his linen shirt and used the soap to scrub the bloodstains from his torso.\nJust then, his brow furrowed. A new worry occurred to him:\nThe injuries were dramatic, the blood abundant. Besides himself, the room itself must be stained!\nAfter a few minutes, Zhou Mingrui had cleaned his shirt. Holding the damp towel, he hurried back home. First, he wiped the bloodstains from his hands on the desk. Then, relying on the gas lamp's light, he searched for other traces.\nHis search yielded results almost immediately. There were numerous splatter stains on the floor and under the desk. And, on the left wall, near the floor, lay a single, bright yellow bullet casing.\n\n\"...Shot himself in the temple with a revolver?\" The disparate clues suddenly connected in his mind. Zhou Mingrui guessed the cause of **克莱恩·莫雷蒂** (Celenne Morty)'s death.\nHe didn't rush to verify this immediately. First, he meticulously cleaned the bloodstains, tidied up the \"scene,\" before picking up the casing and returning to his desk. He opened the revolver's cylinder and ejected the cartridges within.\n*Clickety-clack,* five bullets and one empty casing lay there, gleaming with brass.\n\n\"Indeed…\" Zhou Mingrui glanced at the empty casing, nodding slightly as he carefully reloaded each bullet into the cylinder.\nHis gaze shifted left, falling upon the open notebook where the words \"All men must die, including me\" were written. More questions churned within him.\nWhere did the gun come from?\nSuicide, or a staged suicide?\nWhat could have befallen a history graduate from a **平民** (commoner) family?\nHow did this method of suicide leave so little blood? Was it because his timely transition granted him some inherent **治愈** (healing)?\nHe pondered for a moment, then changed into another linen shirt and sat down in the chair, contemplating the truly crucial matters.\n**克莱恩·莫雷蒂** (Celenne Morty)'s situation, while unfortunate, wasn't his primary concern. The real question was figuring out *why* he had transitioned and whether he could return!\n\nParents, relatives, friends, the lively online world, the variety of delicious food... These were all things he desperately wished to reclaim!\n*Click, click, click...* Zhou Mingrui's right hand absently spun the revolver cylinder, then snapped it shut, repeating the action.\n\"Hmm, things haven't been drastically different from usual, just... unlucky. How could I suddenly transition without any warning?\"\n\"Bad luck... Wait a minute, I performed a **转运仪式** (luck charm) before dinner tonight!\"\nA bolt of lightning flashed through his mind, illuminating the foggy memories obscured by the transition.\nAs a self-proclaimed \"jack of all trades\" in keyboard politics, history, economics, biology, and folklore, he was often derided by his friends as \"a master of only a little bit of everything.\"\nAnd among these \"trades,\" **方术** (occult arts) were included.\nLast year, returning to his hometown, he'd found an old, bound, vertical edition \"**秦汉秘传方术纪要**\" (**Treatise on Secret Transmission of Formulas and Techniques from the Qin and Han Dynasties**). Finding it intriguing, thinking it might help him \"win arguments\" online, he'd bought it. Unfortunately, his interest had faded quickly; the vertical script was difficult to read, and he'd only flipped through the beginning before shelving the book in the corner.\nNow, after a string of misfortunes in the past month – losing his phone, a client backing out, a work error – he'd randomly remembered the luck charm mentioned at the start of the **方术纪要** (Treatise on Secret Transmission of Formulas and Techniques). It required nothing more than simple materials.\nWith nothing to lose, he retrieved the book, followed the instructions, and performed the ritual before his dinner. But nothing happened then.\nUntil the middle of the night, when he had transitioned!\nHe *had* transitioned!\n\"It's a definite possibility that the luck charm was responsible... Hmm, I'll try performing it here tomorrow. If it was indeed the cause, then perhaps there's a way back!\" Zhou Mingrui stopped spinning the revolver, sitting up straight.\nHe had to try, no matter what. Even a dead horse is worth riding for a chance at a cure!",
